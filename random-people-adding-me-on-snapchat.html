Snapchat has this feature where it determines which friends you have added, and they will show possible mutual friends you have. People that see you on Quick Add may add you if they know you."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So how do you disable Quick Add on Snapchat?</h2><p>That's a fairly straightforward process:</p><li>Launch Snapchat.

Once you create your Snapchat username, that's going to be the handle that you use on the application. But what if you were in high school and had an unhealthy obsession with 5 Seconds of Summer and your username reflects that? Well, you'll either have to delete it or create a new account from a new email address or phone number.</p><p>Or you could just honor your past and embrace the fact that you were a 5SOS die hard.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I would do anything to change my Snapchat username</p>â€” autumn hayenga (@AutumnHayenga) <a href=#>July 11, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How do I delete/deactivate my Snapchat account?</h2><p>If you really don't want to use your Snapchat account or want to get rid of that OG username, you can follow the full instructions on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapchat's support page here</a>.</p><p>Note: You do have 30 days to reverse your decision should you want to rejoin the application and keep all of your account information intact.
