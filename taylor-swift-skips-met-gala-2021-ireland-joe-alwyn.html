The singer did not attend the 2021 Met Gala on Sept. 13, but just days prior, she was having loads of fun in Ireland. Staff members at the bar and restaurant she attended posted several photos with Taylor from her time in the city, and she looked like she was having a blast.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The singer was seen holding a drink in her hand in many of the photos. She wore her hair up, with her curly bangs across her forehead. Taylor rocked her classic bold red lip for both occasions, and willingly took selfies with all of the employees. Although <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her boyfriend</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Joe Alwyn</strong>, was not present in the photos, Taylor was reportedly in town to spend time with him as he filmed his upcoming show, Conversations With Friends. We love a supportive girlfriend!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>üì∑ | New photo of Taylor Swift from Friday night at The Tipsy Bird in Belfast, Northern Ireland ‚Äî she was there supporting Joe who has just wrapped up filming the TV series ‚ÄòConversations with Friends‚Äô <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/jKRSDLt1ut</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>‚Äî Taylor Swift News üß£ (@TSwiftNZ) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 13, 2021</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Taylor has not attended the Met Gala since 2016, when she actually served as co-chair of the event. Taylor famously had bleached blonde hair for the high-profile event that year, and it wound up being an evening that changed her life. The 2016 Met Gala was when Taylor first laid eyes on Joe&nbsp;(she recounted the experience in her 2017 song ‚ÄúDress‚Äù). However, at the time, she was dating <strong>Calvin Harris</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Despite thinking Joe was ‚Äúgorgeous‚Äù the first time she met him, Taylor spent a lot of time with a different guy that night ‚Äî&nbsp;<strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>. Less than a month after the event, Taylor and Calvin broke up, and she subsequently started dating Tom. They had a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hot and heavy</a> summer fling, but once it ended in September, she quietly got together with Joe. News of their relationship didn‚Äôt go public until May 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-skip-met-gala-ireland-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Taylor and Joe have since made a point to keep <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their relationship</a> extremely private. They are rarely seen out in public together, and have yet to walk a red carpet as a couple. However, the lyrics in Taylor‚Äôs songs have definitely given us some insight into the pair‚Äôs very serious relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>That doesn‚Äôt mean that Tay is afraid to re-live her heartbreak of the past, though! She is currently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in the process</a> of re-recording her first six albums so that she can earn the rights to them. After releasing the re-record of&nbsp;Fearless&nbsp;in April, she‚Äôs <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bringing Red back</a> next, along with a handful of songs that didn‚Äôt make the original cut of the 2012 album. Taylor has described&nbsp;Red as her ‚Äúonly true breakup album,‚Äù so she definitely had to tap into some feelings from the past to sing those songs once again!&nbsp;Red (Taylor‚Äôs Version) comes out on Nov. 19.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BtZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2ouKq80maknqxdnK6trYxrZ2tpXZ6%2FprjAp5tmop%2BaeqK41rKlaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./krissy-cela.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Krissy Cela</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ppcocaine-20010601-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Ppcocaine (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
