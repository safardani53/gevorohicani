The pair have been married for over three decades and still going strong. Let’s meet the gorgeous lady, who doesn’t have an Instagram or social media presence, but can be seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>here</strong></a>, below.</p><h2>What Does Maureen Do?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>When Charles met Maureen, reportedly after one of his games, she was coming off a successful modeling career. After their marriage, she became very much involved with humanitarian efforts such as the Fresh Start Women’s Foundation, according to their <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>.</p><h2>When Did They Get Hitched</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy, playful 29th <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#WeddingAnniversary</a> wishes to NBA legend Charles Barkley and his wife Maureen! <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Brides</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Wedding</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Invitations</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#Stationery</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#IvoryIsleDesigns</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/yGZUUewCb7</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— Josie Helmstetter (@IvoryIsleDesign) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>February 9, 2018</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Charles and Maureen had a brief courting period and made it official in 1989.

That’s how she got her name, Christiana,” he said. When Ernie asked him, “Why?,” he hilariously answered, “I don’t know. I just like the mall.”</p><h2>Secret To Their Marriage</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Staying together for over 3 decades is quite a feat for Hollywood folk. Charles even joked that the one “secret” to his long, successful marriage is that he’s gone all the time. “Well, No. 1 I’m gone a lot. That always helps,” he quipped in a 2021 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sports Illustrated</a> interview, before adding, “I think the main reason is she accepts my flaws and all. She doesn’t judge me, accepts me how I am, she’s a great mother.”</p><h2>Madonna Almost Came Between Them</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Maureen Blumhardt, Charles Barkley’s Wife: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know – <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>https://t.co/rNIDYjmNIM</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/k3cEjVjrjz</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>— Happy Day 24 (@CryptoTech24) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May 11, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>As super fans know, their romance was almost thwarted by rumors of a Charles and Madonna fling!&nbsp;During the 1993&nbsp;NBA Finals, rumors started to swirl that Sir Charles was canoodling with superstar <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Madonna</strong></a>. Even after Charles denied it, the rumor would not go away. At one point, the star believed the incident caused his mother-in-law to suffer a heart attack. according to the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Chicago Tribune</a>.&nbsp; “She (his mother-in-law) has had a lot of stress from the jokes about me and Madonna (dating) and has been harassed with people (media) calling the house,” Charles told the outlet in June 1993. “She’s not doing well right now and that’s a major concern. I only met her (Madonna) one time when she was in Phoenix. We don’t date. We don’t have a relationship.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“They should leave my wife and daughter alone. When my wife goes out, they play Madonna songs, they’re calling my in-laws. This stuff is ridiculous, unbelievable,” he continued. “Nothing happened. I’m trying to concentrate on the finals, but this is harassment of me and my family.” Charles and the Phoenix Suns would go on to lose to <strong>Michael Jordan</strong> and the Chicago Bulls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KhmKuklah6o63RpKOesV2stqexjG5oaWplZn1w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carson-daly-jokes-about-today-show-baby-making-juice-jenna-bush-hager-dylan-dreyer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carson Daly Jokes About Today Show's 'Baby Making Juice'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jake-hill-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Jake Hill Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
