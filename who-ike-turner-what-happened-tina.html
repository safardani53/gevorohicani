And so then, when we drove to marry, that wasn’t my idea of my wedding.”</p><p>"I get emotional with certain conversations," she added.</p><p>"I get emotional because in the beginning, Ike was very good to me.”</p><p>While Ike might've been good to her in the beginning, things quickly changed after they tied the knot, which is why she later left him.</p><p>“He didn’t like that he had had to depend on me,” Tina explained.</p><p>“And I didn’t want to start a fight because it was always a black eye, a broken nose, a busted lip, a rib.”</p><p>In a 1985 interview with <a href=# aria-label="Spin Magazine (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spin Magazine</a>, Ike admitted to the abuse, saying that he "don’t regret nothing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/05/null-JS820213847.jpg><p>"...It's years ago that I had a temper I don’t regret nothing I’ve ever done, absolutely nothing, man, because it took all of that to make me what I am today — and I love me today, I really do," he told the outlet.</p><p>"Yeah, I hit her, but I didn’t hit her more than the average guy beats his wife. The truth is, our life was no different from the guy next door’s. It’s been exaggerated. People buy bad news, dirty news. If she says I abused her, maybe I did.”</p><p>After Tina left Ike, she struggled financially but she was able to persevere and become <a href=#>one of the most iconic faces</a> in <a href=#>rock and roll</a> history.</p><h2>What was Ike Turner famous for?</h2><p>Outside of being known as Tina's ex-husband, Ike was known for his "boogie-woogie piano and whammy-bar guitar signatures," according to his <a aria-label="St. Louis Walk of Fame biography (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">St. Louis Walk of Fame biography</a>.</p><p>Ike performed with the band Kings of Rhythm and released the 1951 single Rocket 88, which is often regarded as the first rock and roll record.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Kings of Rhythm eventually evolved into the musical duo Ike & Tina Turner.</p><p>Ike also produced songs like A Fool in Love, It’s Gonna Work Out Fine, and Proud Mary, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYmV%2BcoGQaK6hp12euKZ5066pp52iYsSprdNmn5qooJq7prCMraCnmV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andrei-castravet-and-libbys-sister-becky-fight-on-90-day-fiance-happily-ever-after.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andrei Castravet and Libby's Sister Becky FIGHT on 90 Day Fiance Happily Ever After</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-deborah-norville-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Deborah Norville Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
