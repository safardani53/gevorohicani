Sell By actor <strong>Scott Evans</strong> enlisted the help of his older brother <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Chris</strong></a> to fix his at-home haircut during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>On Sunday, March 22, Scott took to Twitter to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">share a video of himself</a> shaving his head in the bathroom of his home.</p><p>Armed with a trimmer, he said “I’m really doing this” before screaming in panic as he shed chunks of hair. Halfway through, he asked himself, “Is this a good idea?”</p><p>He then continued the conversation with himself and said, “Well, there’s no going back now.” Once he was pleased with the results, the 36-year-old shared the video footage on Twitter with the caption, “Head has been shaved.”</p><p>That same day, he took a selfie of the finished result for his 62.6k Twitter followers and in the accompanying Tweet, he wrote, “Final product.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Don’t worry <a href=#>@itskatelambert</a>, my brother helped me even it out. 😜 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/a2s2vaEQ9a</a></p><p>— Scott Evans (@thescottevans) <a href=#>March 24, 2020</a></p><p>Actress and writer Kate Lambert <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responded to the Tweet</a>&nbsp;and said, “Couldn’t be cuter if you tried. But ya missed a spot.” She zoomed in on the actor’s selfie to reveal a few hairs that were longer than the rest.</p><p>Scott tweeted back at Lambert with a video of his brother Chris evening out his new ‘do. “Don’t worry @itskatelambert, my brother helped me even it out.”</p><p>The two brothers ventured back to the bathroom so that Chris could go over his hair with a trimmer for a clean, polished finish.</p><p>As the coronavirus outbreak intensifies, hair salons and other beauty-related services have closed across the nation. In response, stars have been forced to DIY their hair color or recruit a trusty family member to freshen up their locks.</p><p>On Monday, March 19, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pink’s</strong></a> husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Carey Hart</strong></a>, pulled a Scott Evans. He gave himself an at-home buzzcut on the front porch, ditching his long locks for a military-style ‘do. As the hitmaker filmed her husband <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trimming his hair off</a>, she said, “We’re going Full Metal Jacket people.”</p><p>Carey shared the before-and-after pics of his transformation on Instagram and captioned the photo series, “Send help. I’m losing it!!! #FullMetalQuarantine.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i1s7XSZpyvmZ6oeqTB06xkm6qfqbWmvoysmqispKh6qa3Iq2SdraKeu6h5wqitopxdZoZutdKoo5qsmaS7brzInKpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-evert-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Evert Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Salary [2023 Update]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miss-mulattos-boyfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miss Mulattos Boyfriend: Who is Miss Mulatto Dating?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
