Total since release: £50million.</strong></p><p>Noddy Holder and Slade musician Jim Lea penned the song, which reached number one in 1973.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Music</h2></p><p>It’s stood the test of time since then, re-entering the charts each year, and making a pretty penny for the pair who wrote and composed it.&nbsp;</p><p>Today Noddy, 77, has started performing again, six years after he was told he had only six months to live after a diagnosis of oesophageal cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>Noddy, worth around £25million, signed up to a chemotherapy trial which saved his life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl, Fairytale of New York</h2><p><strong>Annual royalties: £400,000.

Total since release: £9million.</strong></p><p>Wizzard were a rock band formed by Roy Wood, a former member of the Move and co-founder of the Electric Light Orchestra.&nbsp;</p><p>Their biggest track, I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day, was released in 1973 and performed on Top of the Pops.</p><p>Famously, it peaked at number two in the charts after losing out to Slade in a battle of the true Christmas classics.</p><p>Roy, 77, is still bringing the festive magic with his event ‘Rockmas’, which this year stars features Paul Young.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chris Rea, Driving Home for Christmas</h2><p><strong>Annual royalties: £200,000.

Total since release: £5.4million</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jona-lewie-stop-cavalry-204321180-1.jpg><p>Jona, whose real name is John, says that thanks to the success of Stop the Cavalry in 1978, he now just "tinkers around" in his studio.</p><p>The song is an anti-war protest starting ‘Hey Mr Churchill comes over here…’</p><p>He admits he didn’t intend it to become a festive song "I absolutely did not sit down with the idea of writing a big Christmas hit. I don't think I would have been able to.”</p><p>Jona added that it provides half of his back catalogue income.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shakin Stevens Merry Christmas Everyone</h2><p><strong>Annual royalties: £140,000.
