Following her conviction, she was ordered to stay away from the teenager, and she was labeled as a sex offender.&nbsp;</p><p>But, after she served seven years in prison, she and Fualaau got married in 2005, separated several times, and welcomed another child together.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>After a six month battle with cancer, Letourneau passed away at the age of 58 on July 6, 2020.

Mary fought tirelessly against this terrible disease," the statement began.&nbsp;</p><p>The announcement continued with confirmation that Letourneau was surrounded by her loved ones while she battled colon cancer.</p><p>At the end of the statement, the Letourneau and Fualaau families confirmed that there would be no subsequent comments on her death.</p><p>"We will have no further statements or comments as we celebrate and honor the wishes of our wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, sister, beloved family member and loyal friend and concentrate on caring for one another," it concluded.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here is an EXCLUSIVE statement given to me by the Letourneau and Fualaau families about the passing of Mary Kay Letourneau. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YFliUbejpv</a></p>— Danielle Bacher (@DBacherwrites) <a href=#>July 8, 2020</a></figure><p>The mention of Letourneau being a "wife" confused some, as she had been separated from Fualaau since 2019. In April of 2020, a source close to Letourneau confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that she was on a dating site, and she was looking to forge a connection with someone closer in age to her.&nbsp;</p><p>Letourneau and Fualaau had filed for a legal separation in August of 2019, and the two later officially divorced that same year.</p><p>The 2019 filing wasn't the first time that Fualaau and Letourneau had decided to end their marriage. Their first official split was in 2017, after Fualaau filed for a separation. The two later decided to reconcile, and the separation was withdrawn. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Vili Fualaau returned to Washington to be by his ex-wife's bedside.</h2><p>Despite legally ending their relationship in 2019, Vili Fualaau was with Letourneau during much of her cancer battle. The 37-year-old's lawyer, David Gehrke, confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a> that Fualaau had moved back to Washington to be with his ex-wife once he learned of her grave illness.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"Vili moved back from California, gave up his life there, and for the last two months of Mary's life he stood by her 24/7 taking care of her. So yes, they were divorced and they had their spats, but they were always in love with each other," David explained.&nbsp;</p><p>The lawyer then spoke of the couple's unbreakable bond, and how important it was to both of them that they were together for the end of Letourneau's life.&nbsp;</p><p>Vili Fualaau "knew that this was Mary's end coming, fast moving, and for her sake and the family's sake, and for his sake, he came back up and was with her, and it meant the world to her," David continued. "And I know it meant the world to Vili, as painful as it was."</p><p>Mary Kay Letourneau leaves behind six children.&nbsp;</p><p>Her kids with Vili Fualaau are now adults; Georgia is 21, while Audrey is 23.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60ecyaqbJlm5bGbrjEraauqp6arrZ50q2gpaRdoq6zvsiemw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bobby-murphys-wife-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bobby Murphys Wife: Who is Bobby Murphy Dating?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./teaira-walker.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Teaira Walker Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
