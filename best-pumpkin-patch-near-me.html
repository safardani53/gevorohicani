And by great outdoors, we mean your local pumpkin patch. Even if you live in major cities like New York or Los Angeles, you don't have to travel too far to pick some gourds, ride a wagon full of hay, or get lost in a corn maze.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, just think of the content you will be creating for your Instagram followers. It's a win-win for everyone. Check out the list below for the best pumpkin patch near your zip code.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1.

Chicago</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span><p>Goebbert's Pumpkin Patch.</p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sonny Acres Farm</a> is definitely an Instagram-approved pumpkin patch.
