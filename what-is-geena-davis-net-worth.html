"&nbsp;It was a small movie, very small budget, and we just hoped people would see it and not hate the ending, you know? We had no clue it would strike a nerve like that."</p><p>Following her advocation for herself, in 2004, Davis revealed that she noticed there were more boys than girls in the TV shows her daughter watched and from then on, she wanted to make a change in the industry.</p><p>She also opened up the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media whose research, "examines intersectional onscreen representation of six identities: gender, race, LGBTQ+, disability, age, and body size."</p><p>In her 2018 documentary, This Changes Everything, Davis revealed that male to female casting is now 50-50 among productions.</p><p>When Smith asked Davis if she believes Hollywood is finally understanding the gap, she said that she does.</p><p>"I think so," Davis answered. "You know, they made 'Black Widow,' you know, which recently opened to great success. And I think we're definitely headed more in that direction. To have more blockbusters with women in the lead roles, is definitely happening more, which is very exciting."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668288767.jpg><h2>Does Geena Davis have children?</h2><p>Davis has been married four times throughout her life.</p><p>Her most recent marriage was to Reza Jarrahy from 2001-2017.</p><p>While married, the two had three children together; daughter Alizeh Keshvar, 19; and twins Kian William and Kaiis Steven, 17.</p><p>Davis did not become a mom until her 40s, but that decision she told Huff Post was right for her.</p><p>"I felt 100% that I would be such a better parent than I would have been even five years earlier and certainly 10 or 20 years earlier," she revealed.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more from celebrity net worths</h2></p><p>"If I’d had kids earlier, I could easily have become one of those mothers who overinvolve themselves and try to live life through their kids. I’m sure there are younger people who have figured things out long before I did, but in my case, I became a parent with exactly the right person,&nbsp;at exactly the right time."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>While she advocates for women all throughout the media industry, she makes sure to empower her daughter too and set a good example.</p><p>"Maybe no woman has been president of the United States yet, but her mother has ― on TV," Davis said. "I can tell her how to form her own opinions and not let our culture dictate what’s appropriate for women to be and do."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrY2mEenyXaK6hmaRitrR5xp6cp5ldma63tdJmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-kel-mitchells-net-worth-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Kel Mitchell's net worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./country-strong-cast-then-and-now-photos-4299288.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tim McGraw, Gwyneth Paltrow &amp;amp; More Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
