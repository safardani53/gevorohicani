Not a whole lot, but the German car maker made it work.</p><p>Running on the slogan "the original, updated", VW used modified CGI footage of late actor Gene Kelly hip-hop dancing next to the motor.</p><p>The catchy clip might not show much of the car, but it perfectly demonstrates the idea that the model has been given a modern twist.<br></p><h3>Explosive TV</h3><span class=article__bc_video-caption>This Peugeot TV advert will 'take your breath away'</span><p>Possibly the most epic car ad of all time, Peugeot's late 1980's promotion for their 405 model is a real spectacle.</p><p>The French marquee thought their new car would take your breath away, so they dubbed footage of the car driving through flaming fields with the Berlin track.</p><p>It's simple, but there's not denying it's effective.<br></p><h3>The Squeaky Earring</h3><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Hilarious VW TV advert shows driver unable to find squeaky noise inside his car</span><p>This story-based ad is another courtesy of Volkswagen from 1990.</p><p>A male driver is out on the road with his female passenger, and is madly searching for an irritating squeaking noise in the car.</p><p>Eventually the driver pulls into a service station, where the mechanic discovers the squeak is coming from the female passenger's earring.</p><p>The ad finishes with the line: "If only everything was as reliable as a Volkswagen."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest motors news</h2></p><p>Derren Martin, head of current valuations at HPI, said: “Over the years we’ve seen some outstanding, memorable car adverts ranging from the epic and Hollywood blockbuster-esque to the more subtle and clever.</p><p>"Manufacturers are always trying to go one better than their competitors with striking visuals, memorable soundtracks or catchy straplines.</p><p>“One thing is for sure and that is when it comes to motor advertising simply showcasing a car's features is not enough - it takes much more than that to make a memorable advert.</p><p>"Car makers spend big money on advertising, so it’s no wonder that certain ads are so memorable and stand the test of time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHx3gJBya2pwX6m1pnnBnqqtZaSreqSt0WaYna6Vp8G0ec6fZJqknGLBqrnEZp2rp51isaK6wqKloGWipK%2BwwNJmq6hllaW2pHnEsaelp6OevK%2B%2FjJqlnWWRYrCivoymmJ2dXZq7tbXRnqOyZZanvK55wpqinmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./madison-lecroy-engagement-details-the-proposal-the-reaction-and.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Proposal!
