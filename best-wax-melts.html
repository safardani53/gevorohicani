They also make for an amazing Christmas gift.</p><p>Wax melts are cheap, long-lasting ways to scent the home. While wax melts are similar to scented candles, they do have some extra, unique perks.</p><p>The wick-free melts tend to be cheaper, typically last longer and are chemical-free, so work well in a home with young kids or an office space.</p><p>They're also considered more environmentally friendly and still have the same benefits of scented candles, infusing your home with fragrance, as well as providing aromatherapy pros.</p><p>Wax melts typically come in cubes, bars or sweet little shapes like hearts and stars (cute gift alert!).</p><p>They're a great way to test out a scent on the cheap before committing to it, since you'll often find them in sets with small chunks containing different fragrances.</p><p>If you're a newbie to wax melts, you will need to buy a wax melt warmer in order to use your wax melts (you typically light a tea light in a ceramic wax melt holder).</p><p>You can find several different styles of burner on Amazon, in different shapes and materials, many for under £10 – here, we've rounded up a selection of the best wax melts you can buy right now.</p><h2><strong>Best wax melts at a glance:</strong></h2><h2>Amazon Handmade Wax Melts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-05-at-10.49.19-e1579168452986.png><ul><li><strong><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Handmade highly scented wax melts, 10 x 5g melts for £4.95 from Amazon – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p><span class=a-list-item>This assorted set of 10 wax melts includes good-enough-to-eat flavours like black plum and rhubarb, sparkling lemon, coffee mocha and coconut.</span></p><p><span class=a-list-item>The bright colours and chocolate-box shapes make them a great assortment of gifts for the scent-sational friend in your life.</span></p><p>They're extremely budget-friendly, too - for under a fiver you get 10 5g melts in a range of eye-catching, fun shapes and unique scents that linger and bring joy to any room.</p><h2>Yankee Candle Wax Melts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/yankee-candle-christmas-eve-wax-melt-e1632133187301.jpg><ul><li><strong>Christmas Eve wax melt 22g, £1.99 from Yankee Candle – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Yes, wax melts come in fabulous seasonal scents, too - and what better time to stock up for Christmas?!

Want bold colours? You'll need some candle dye too.</p><p>First of all fill a saucepan with 300ml of water and bring it to simmer, before putting a glass bowl filled with your beeswax, coconut oil and candle dye on top to melt it all while stirring with a wooden spoon.</p><p>When everything has melted, take it off the heat and add your essential oils.</p><p>Then, you're going to want to pour it into a mould. If you want pretty heart-shaped or flower wax melts, then you should buy those. Top tip: cookie cutters work too!</p><p>For wax melts kits, check out the below.</p><ul><li><strong>636Pcs Wax Seal Stamp Kit, £22.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li><li><strong>NA Wax Melt Kit, £35.99 from Amazon -<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> buy here</a></strong></li><li><strong>Ultimate Wax Melt Starter Kit, £16.99 from Etsy - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li><li><strong>DIY Wax Melt Making Kits, £19.99 from Etsy - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpoYm19dYGWaJmeq6RixKLEjKacpayjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ana-brenda-contreras-calls-off-her-marriage-starts-dating-sanchez.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ana Brenda Contreras calls off her Marriage; starts dating Sanchez</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-hilary-farr-a-real-designer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Love It or List It's' Hilary Farr Is More Than an HGTV Host</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
