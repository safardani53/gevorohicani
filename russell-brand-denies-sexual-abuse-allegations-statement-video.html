The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>comedian</a> has reportedly been <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>accused by four women</a> of the alleged sexual assaults, which apparently took place between 2006 and 2013. At the time, he was working for BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4 and was starring in various films, including Get Him to the Greek and Rock of Ages.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve received two extremely disturbing letters, or a letter and an email, one from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper, listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks,” Russell began in the video. “But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks, are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Although Russell didn’t name a TV company or newspaper, a new special investigation episode of the U.K. current affairs show, Dispatches, is airing on Saturday night. Presenter <strong>Krishnan Guru-Murthy</strong> sparked speculation about the episode when he shared a now deleted screenshot of the show with the caption, “Something’s up,” according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Evening Standard</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Further in his video, which can be seen above, Russell claimed that any relationships he had during a period of “promiscuity” were all “consensual” and not one-sided. “These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies,” he explained. “And as I’ve written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous. Now during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/russell-brand-denies-sexual-abuse-allegations-video-embed.jpg><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was always transparent about that then — almost too transparent,” he added. “And I’m being transparent about it now as well. And to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal, that I absolutely deny.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Just hours after Russell shared the video, he was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>met with cheers</a> by a sold out crowd at his comedy show at Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre in London, England. “I love you. I love you. Thank you. There’s some things I cannot talk about and hopefully you appreciate that I’m gonna give you everything I’ve got,” he reportedly told the audience after coming out on stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5BvZquto6iyrbiMm6mappRisaa6yJ6qZquVrcKiuIyama6rlWKurbjEoJitoZ%2BjwG6%2F05qrnqWVo8FuwsidnKhn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./greggs-50-years-cant-believe-vegan-sausage-rolls-success.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I worked at Greggs for 50 years and I still can't believe one of its most popular lines ever took of</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-blunt-says-she-s-appalled-by-video-showing-her-calling-server-enormous-i-m-so-sorry-exclusive-8364737.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Blunt Issues Apology for Old Video Showing Her Using Insensitive Language</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
