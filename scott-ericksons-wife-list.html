If it's something they're passionate about, they'll labor tirelessly until they achieve it. They have a long life full of vitality and wonder about the world. Relationships are important to monkeys as well. However, pampering children may be one of their flaws.</p><p>People born on February 2 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Aquarius</strong>.
