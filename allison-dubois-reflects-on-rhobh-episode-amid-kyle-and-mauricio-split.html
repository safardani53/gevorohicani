It’s like predicting a death, but a death of a relationship.”</p><p>In the 2010 season 1 episode, aptly titled “Dinner Party From Hell,” Allison was invited over by RHOBH alum <a href=#><strong>Camille Grammer</strong></a> for a soirée with some of her costars. The psychic — who inspired the TV series Medium — gave Kyle, 54, a reading and claimed that she and Mauricio, 53, would not last. (Us confirmed on Monday, July 3, that <a href=#>the couple called it quits</a> after 27 years of marriage.)</p><p>“I went back and I had to look at the words that I used at the time that he will never emotionally fulfill her,” she told Us. “I stand by that.”</p><p>Allison, for her part, teased that the get-together was not at all what she expected, noting that it was “not fun” and about “four hours long.”</p><p>“[Kyle] exuded anger from the get-go. She was watching me, she was observing me, almost trying to size me up and I just was there to have a good time,” she confessed. “I was told it was a girls’ night. I was like, ‘Yay! I never go to girls’ nights. I’m always working, this is great.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Allison-DuBois-Reflects-on-RHOBH-Episode-Amid-Kyle-and-Mauricio-Split-featured.png><p>While Allison was excited about the party, she revealed she couldn’t help but feel that <a href=#>the drama was inevitable</a> and that the episode would become one of the most famous in RHOBH history.</p><p>After the episode aired, viewers speculated that Allison was picking up on Camille’s energy and mistook it for Kyle. Camille, 54, went through a <a href=#>public divorce</a> from ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Kelsey Grammer</strong></a> in 2011, one year after the episode first aired. While Allison and Camille were close friends at the time, the medium revealed she is <a href=#>no longer close</a> with the former reality star.</p><p>“After the dinner party, [Camille] brought the recording of [the episode] over before it aired to show me. I was mortified,” she admitted. “But then to see the cuts of her setting it up to make it seem like I knocked a few too many back [it] really bothered me because she pre-taped that.”</p><p>Alison confessed that she found it “really hard to stay friends” with Camille after the incident.</p><p>Since her iconic appearance on the Bravo hit, Allison has released her own podcast, “The Dead Life,” where she interviews people who have witnessed death or have claimed to have an <a href=#>experience of life after death</a>.</p><p>“I like to see different people from different walks of life share their experiences of life after death. And my listeners really enjoy it,” she explained, noting she’s talked to doulas, pet psychics and more. “We do different things. I love doing the podcast.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The Dead Life” has new episodes available every Tuesday and is available to listen on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and more.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJilpJmovK95w66ZqKGjYr%2Bmssuemq2rXaS7br7HqJmhZZWltrS7w55kmqWZmXqsxcueZJqmlGK6osHRopqip12ova2102g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./magaluf-famous-party-strip-close-brits-vomiting-jumping-cars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brits' fury as cops start to SHUT DOWN iconic party strip after pics of drunk tourists vomiting in s</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jack-antonoff-net-worth-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Jack Antonoff's Net Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
