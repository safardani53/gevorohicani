You will be after watching the new music video from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Legend</strong></a>. The actor, singer, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Academy Award winner</a> released the visual for “Wild” on Aug. 13, and it stars none other than his better half, his wife and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother of his children</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a>. Oh, and does she ever go crazy with the PDA. In the track, which features guitar god-in-the-making&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gary Clark Jr</a>.</strong>, the couple decided to get away from the stress of the world and drive each other — well,&nbsp;wild.&nbsp;Like two young lovers who have just fallen in love, John and Chrissy get crazy with the PDA, kissing on a beach in Mexico, making out in a pool at a luxurious resort, and getting busy in bed.&nbsp;However, as their relationship progresses, it’s not all PDA and smiles. The two find themselves in a fight and clashing. It looks like things are going to end on sad note — before love triumphs! Chrissy and John make up, and we see them reunite — along with their two adorable kids,&nbsp;<strong>Miles</strong>, 2, and 4-year-old&nbsp;<strong>Luna!&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Just one listen to this track, and it was clear who John was singing to. “I wanna drive you / Wild, wild, wild,” he sings on the chorus, per Genius. “I wanna love you / For miles and miles / We can go slow / We don’t need to rush / I’ll take the wheel, make you feel every touch / I wanna drive you /Wild, wild, wild.” With such steamy lyrics like that, it would be odd if Chrissy didn’t appear in the video, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/john-legend-chrissy-teigen-new-music-video-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>“Wild” comes off of John’s new album, Bigger Love, which he released on June 19. Overall, reviews for the record with mixed – it currently has a 59 score on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Metacritic</a> – but <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone </a>called it the “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bear hug we need right now</a>,” adding that the album “shows off the emerging subtlety of [John’s] musical craft and social messaging.” Bigger Love showcases John’s versatility as a songwriter and a musician, with RS noting that the album contains elements doo-wop, soul, R&B, hip-hop, and reggae. To help John with this multi-genre excursion, Bigger Love boasts guest appearances by the previously mentioned Gary Clark Jr<strong>., Jhené Aiko, Koffee, Rapsody, </strong>and <strong>Camper</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>How did “Wild” come together? John revealed some of the songwriting magic with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Apple Music</a>. “There’s a UK songwriting company called TMS that wrote <strong>Lewis Capaldi’s</strong> ‘Someone You Loved,’ and a while back, they reached out with a song they thought would be good for me. I changed a couple of the lyrics, but not much, and Raphael suggested we hit up Gary for a guitar solo. Of course, he graced us with his incredible skill and took the song to another level.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“At some point, I decided I wanted live drums to bring the intensity up a bit, so we brought in a drummer named <strong>Garrison Brown</strong> from Youngstown, Ohio, which is near where I grew up,” adds John. “We quickly put it together that my mom used to go to his church, and a pianist from his church had been a mentor to me. It’s a small world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH15e5BsZqOnmKN6rbHGnqWdZaaesaa7jLCgpZxdmLWztdKssGaslZ60prqO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./m7egvtgmywmunhu7ksgcujqyv-q9oqbp.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hugh-hefner-wife-crystal-playboy-mansion-prison-healing-marriage.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hugh Hefners wife Crystal calls Playboy Mansion prison &amp;amp; says she's still healing fro</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
