Her family members verified the news, and Annette Ramsey, one of her siblings, paid homage to her on Facebook. She stated:</p><p>‚ÄúI will always remember the good moments we had, and the love and support you gave me will not be forgotten.‚Äù ‚ÄúRIP Big Sis, I love you.‚Äù</p><p>Chris Rizik, SoulTracks‚Äô publisher, noted that Sims was a brilliant performer who sang, composed, and performed for them for over three decades. He also said that the music industry would grieve her death and that her effect on music was larger than her three-a-half decades of prominence.&nbsp;Joyce‚Äôs cause of death is unclear, and there is no information on whether she had any health problems. Her family members are presently awaiting an official announcement on the matter.</p><h2>Come Into My Life by Joyce Sims was a Top-10 R&B record.</h2><p>Joyce, who was born on August 6, 1959, rose to prominence with her 1987 single, Come Into My Life. In 1987 and 1988, it peaked at number ten on the US Billboard R&B chart and number ten on the UK Singles Chart. She went to college and studied music as well as a few other instruments. She began her career in 1986 when she signed with the now-defunct record company Sleeping Bag Records and released her debut song, (You Are My) All and All. At the time, the song was on the UK Singles Chart and the US Dance Chart.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Joyce-Sims-1.jpg alt="Joyce Sims" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Joyce Sims‚Äô next track was Come Into My Life, which became her most successful hit and her lone top-10 R&B single. She and Jimmy Castor worked together on a reworking of Love Makes a Woman, which was similarly well received by the public. Sims‚Äô first album, Come Into My Life, was published in 1987 and peaked at number 22 on the US R&B album chart and number 5 on the UK Albums Chart. Except for Love Makes a Woman, she authored every song on the album. Her second album, All About Love, was released in 1989 and peaked at number 64 on the UK Albums Chart.</p><p>Joyce Sims‚Äô next single, Who‚Äôs Crying Now, was released in 1994. Her song What the World Needs Now is Love was published in 2006 as part of her album A New Beginning.&nbsp;In 2009, she published Come into My Life: The Very Best of Joyce Sims, a double CD of her finest singles and remixes, and founded August Rose Records. Joyce‚Äôs second album, Love Song, was published in 2014, and her songs were in the soundtrack of the 1995 science fiction horror film Species. She then released a single called Wishing You Were Here, followed by an album called Back in Love Again.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Joyce-Sims.png alt="Joyce Sims" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Twitter users pay Tribute.</h2><p>Throughout her career, Joyce Sims released a number of popular songs and albums.
