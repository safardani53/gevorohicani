Beauty’s flight crew challenge. But instead of saying it in her voice, she made everyone’s jaws drop with her spot-on impersonations of famous stars. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Grande impersonated <a href=# rel=follow>Celine Dion</a> and Jennifer Coolidge and nailed her best friend&nbsp;Elizabeth Gillies’ facial expression.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Fans enjoyed it and left appreciative comments.
