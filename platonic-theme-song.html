However, with recent hits like <a href=#>Shrinking</a> and <a href=#>Severance</a>, it’s become a reliable one we can always go to for incredible performances and top-tier jokes. The latest light-hearted, yet emotional, romp, Platonic, stars <a href=#>Rose Byrne</a> and Seth Rogan as old friends who are reconnecting after years apart.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But no one song can capture their relationship as it changes and grows throughout the series. So Platonic is taking a risk that only a few series have ever dared accomplished. It has a new theme song every episode.

The lyrics, “I think we are the same kind, you and I,” are exemplary of why they became friends in the first place. The Jon Johns are a lesser-known band than the prior two with just over 16,000 Spotify listeners and albums going back to only 2019.
