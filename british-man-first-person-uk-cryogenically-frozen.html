He wanted to live – he didn’t think that 80-something years were enough, he wanted to live til he was 100 at least.”</p><p>But while finding it difficult to speak with doctors about his father’s terminal illness while trying to organise the next phase of his father’s “life”, Mr Hobson said it was worth it.</p><p>He said: "We have carried out my father's wishes - it wasn't the most pleasant thing to achieve but we did it.</p><p>"I would have felt really guilty."</p><p>The family managed to cover the USD$28,000 cost to have his father, of Sheffield, South Yorks, stored at the Cryonics Institute in Michigan, with the body of the former boxer to be flown out next week.</p><p>There, he will be stored near <a href=#>a 14-year-old British girl who died of a rare form of cancer last year.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000283180889.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000283180869.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000295548573.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000295543822.jpg><p>Mr Hobson said that after the experience, he was now determined to be&nbsp;cryogenically frozen himself, when the time came.</p><p>He said: "Once you are buried or cremated you’ve no chance.</p><p>"This way, whether it’s even 0.00001 per cent, it’s still a chance.</p><p>"I’m not a religious person but whether or not you’re religious, if you think there’s even a chance that you could come back you can see that we have progressed.</p><p>"The world is moving that much quicker – years ago we used to think the world was flat so who knows what we can do into the future?”</p><p>Cryopreservation of humans is not reversible with technology presently available - but many people have faith medical advances will one day allow people to be 'resuscitated and restored'.</p><p>The process is based on the theory that <a href=#>the brain can retain memory and personality while frozen - and that one day, scientists will be able to successfully defrost and heal the bodies.</a></p><p>As stated on Alcor, one such lab that preserves bodies: "Calling someone 'dead' is merely medicine's way of excusing itself from resuscitation problems it cannot fix today."</p><p>Mr&nbsp;Hobson has now thrown himself into organising a farewell for his father, organising live music and a party in place of a funeral, with the body already having gone through the first stage of preservation.</p><p>Paying tribute to the 82-year-old, he said: "He was an absolute character, he was somebody gifted with charisma and he will be sadly missed.</p><p>"He led an adventurous life, he was a man’s man and he had a good voice.</p><p>"He could bring a smile to anybody’s face, from any walk of life.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>Mr Hobson made the announcement of his father's passing on social media, saying: "Lots of people have been asking about dad's funeral arrangements but, in line with his wishes, we're in the process of having him cryogenically frozen so there won't actually be a funeral for people to attend."</p><p>Dennis' family said that they would instead be holding an event at Ponds Forge to celebrate the life of the 82-year-old, who worked as as scrap metal businessman after having gone toe to toe with hundreds of opponents during his time as a bare-knuckle boxer.</p><p>Dennis Hobson Jr said: "In the absence of a funeral it will be a chance for people to celebrate his life.</p><p>"This has obviously been an extremely difficult time."</p><p>He said that the event, held this Saturday, would include live music and showing videos as a tribute for his father, who has been described as a "sincere and loyal person".</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sorry to hear the sad news about Denis Hobson senior passing away.
