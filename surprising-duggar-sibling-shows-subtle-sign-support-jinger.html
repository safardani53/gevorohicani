her siblings as she addresses her autobiography topics in various interviews.</p><p>The reality star recently spoke to <a aria-label="Relatable podcast (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Relatable podcast</a> host, Allie Stuckey, about fundamentalism, the extreme sect of Christianity in which she was raised.</p><p>The TV personality bashed the leader of the Institute in Basic Life Principles church, Bill Gothard, and his radical teachings which she claimed were harmful in a clipped version on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Though Jinger has gone out on a limb to address her troubled childhood in an ultra-conservative household, her sister <a href=#>Joy-Anna</a>, 25, showed a subtle sign of support by "liking" the post.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Jinger Duggar">Read more on Jinger Duggar</h2><p>Another sister <a href=#>Jessa</a>, 30, "liked" a previous post of the interview, silently showing her reinforcement, as well.</p><h2>JESSA'S STRUGGLE</h2><p>Jessa's support came as fans recently claimed they <a href=#>think she could be having a "crisis of faith"</a> due to her sister's upcoming tell-all book.</p><p>Earlier this week,&nbsp;Jinger posted&nbsp;<a href=#>a video on her Instagram</a>&nbsp;that showed her getting prepared for, then participating in, an interview about her book,&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Becoming Free Indeed</a>.</p><h2>FAN THEORIES</h2><p>Taking to&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, one person started a thread and asked: "Does anyone think there is a likelihood of Jessa having a crisis of faith right now?</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"I’m starting to genuinely wonder if there is a possibility that after Jinger started coming out with her story, Jessa is having a similar crisis of faith, and that’s why we’ve barely heard from her."</p><p>They continued: "It also could explain why she hasn’t come out and supported Jinger with her book yet.</p><p>"Maybe she feels confused by what Jinger is doing, but a part of it also feels like the right thing to do.</p><p>"We already know that Ben was the BIL who encouraged Jinger to look past the IBLP before her new headship, so that kind of idea could already be existing in Jessa’s head. What do you guys think?"</p><p>Others quickly commented on the post and offered up their own thoughts.</p><p>"I’m definitely thinking she’s having some type of life crisis right now. But I’m more thinking some type of marriage/family crisis," one person wrote.</p><p>"I don’t believe Ben and her are happy together, they seem more like friends/roommates that have kids together than an actual romantic couple.</p><p>"I think it’s also possible that motherhood wasn’t what she expected and that she might feel like she has lost her identity and spark.</p><p>"If you look back at old videos of her when she was just married or when Spurgeon was young she seems so much happier than now," they added.</p><p>Another person claimed: "I think she has feelings she's just repressed them so deeply.</p><p>"This is very common in conservative/strict families, emotions are not to be expressed and the only acceptable emotion in many homes is anger, at least by the parents, children aren't allowed that one either.</p><p>"Jinger's feeling manifested in anxiety, Jessa's manifested in control," they suggested.</p><p>"She's not a sociopath, she's still in survival mode and can't seem to find her way out of it."</p><h2>JINGER'S NEW LIFE</h2><p>Jinger and her 18 siblings were raised under the teachings of the Institute in Basic Life Principles, a Christian organization established by disgraced minister Bill Gothard.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The sixth child of Jim Bob and Michelle, Jinger left the church in 2017, and has since&nbsp;<a href=#>slammed its teachings as “cult-like.”</a></p><p>The ex-<a href=#>TLC</a>&nbsp;star has written a new book exposing her parent's extreme religious beliefs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/duggar-family-visits-extra-new-772178027-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/taken-without-permission-https-www-784382828-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYmiBeoWVaKquqqCntrS1zaBkna2XnK6zedKimaWhnpx6tLTOsKpmq6WXwa2xjKygoKZdqMKxvM6rq2aimaO0pr6O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-cleo-sol-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Cleo Sol Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./selling-sunsets-chrishell-stause-reason-broke-up-jason.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Selling Sunset's Chrishell Stause reveals the real reason she broke up with Jason Oppenheim after fi</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
