Eric, now 32, stole 30 bags of Chesters Flamin’ Hots, eight bags of Chesters Flamin Hots Popcorn and 16 bags of Cheetos Flamin Hots.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the incident report, an officer observed Eric “walking quickly from the One Stop Pantry carrying a large box of food items in his hands and a blue Adidas bag around his shoulders.”</p><p>The officer attempted to stop and talk to the then-teen, but he “dropped the items he was carrying in the street… and fled on foot down the alley westbound.”</p><p>The report claims he was advised by two officers to “stop several times,” but he failed to.&nbsp;</p><p>The cop then collected the food items and returned them to the One Stop Pantry store.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The clerk observed the suspect “entering the store and took several items without paying for them.”</p><p>The officer then described security footage that corroborated the clerk’s story.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric returned to where he dropped the items and was taken into custody by authorities.&nbsp;</p><p>He asked one of the officers if he “could go apologize to the clerk in the store for taking the items.”</p><p>A court clerk confirmed to The Sun that the case was dismissed.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric did not respond to The Sun's request for comment.</p><h2 id=turning-his-life-around>TURNING HIS LIFE AROUND</h2><p>Eric has turned his life around since his teenage years.&nbsp;</p><p>He has dabbled in modeling and has an interest in boxing, as he has posted photos training at the gym.&nbsp;</p><p>Deon has seemingly taken Eric under his wing, as he referred to him as his “son” and his 14 children’s “big brother” on various occasions.</p><p>On the show, Eric <a href=#>helps Deon with his real estate business</a> and offered to be a nanny for their children.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=deon-s-legal-woes>DEON'S LEGAL WOES</h2><p>Deon has had legal troubles of his own.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deon was charged with 13 counts</a>, including theft, false representation concerning title, multiple transactions involving fraud or deceit, and more crimes on June 24, 2014.&nbsp;</p><p>For the theft counts, Deon and a co-defendant were accused of “participating in a fraudulent scheme, to either directly or indirectly gain control of real property… by filing two fraudulent and fictitious quitclaim deeds with the Clark County Recorder’s Office, transferring the [victim’s] property into the name of Derrico and depriving the [victim] of their property.”</p><p>The property was valued at over $3,500.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the false representation concerning title counts, the parties were accused of “executing or causing a false or forged quitclaim deed to be recorded in the Clark County Recorder’s Office," according to court papers.</p><p>Deon and the co-defendant also allegedly “notarized the signature of [the victim] on a quitclaim deed to the property belonging to [the victim] without being in the presence of [the victim] and without providing a credible witness or necessary evidence of identification.”</p><p>Deon pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.&nbsp;</p><p>The case went to trial in 2018, and an attorney for the State of Nevada requested Deon’s children not be mentioned to the jury because it “might distract the jury from the facts of the case.”</p><p>Deon was found not guilty, except for one count of false representation concerning title and one count of notarization of signature of person not in presence of notary public.</p><p>The jury was “deadlocked” and the court ordered a “mistrial.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Deon said to a news outlet following the verdict: “It was a feeling out of this world.
