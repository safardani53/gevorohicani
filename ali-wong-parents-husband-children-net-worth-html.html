Born Alexandra Dawn Wong, she is best known for the voice of the titular character Bertie in&nbsp;Tuca & Bertie and Ali in Big Mouth.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Wong is an actress, comedian, producer, and writer who has been active in the industry since the early 2010s. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started her career</a> in comedy from college as a theater student.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>After college, she got a scholarship to study in Vietnam, after which she returned to the USA. It was then she decided to pursue her career in comedy full-time.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She started doing open mics and stand-ups, which soon skyrocketed her career. In 2011, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Variety named her</a> as one of the ‘10 comics to watch.’ <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>That opened a lot of doors for her. Since then, she has worked very hard to be one of the sought-after artists. However, she could not have done it all alone. She had a support system consisting of her parents and husband.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ali Wong’s Parents</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On October 20, 2019, Wong discussed her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">parents’ life story</a> on NPR. Her father, Adolphus, is a Chinese-American anesthesiologist, while&nbsp;her mother, Tam, is a Vietnamese American who came to the USA in 1960. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Adolphus came from a low-income family. He grew up in Chinatown in a one-bedroom apartment with two sisters and his parents.&nbsp;</p><p>The apartment had no running water, and there was only one bed he shared with his mother and siblings. The situation was so bad that Adolphus’s father had to sleep on newspapers.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Tam came to the USA when she was 20. Unlike most Vietnamese people, who came to the country in 1975 after the war, Tam&nbsp;made her way to the USA before the official start of the infamous Vietnam war.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since both of them had a hard lifestyle, they worked very hard to change it for their four kids. In addition, Adolphus and Tam inspired their daughter in the field of arts.</p><p>They always took Wong to the Asian American Film Festivals, where the actress saw herself being represented on the big screens.&nbsp;This built confidence in Wong, who eventually made&nbsp;a&nbsp;career in movies and series.</p><p>Adolphus was always supportive of his daughter. Even when Wong was a struggling comedian, he would attend her shows and be proud of his daughter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Ali Wong’s Husband and Children</h2><p>Wong is married to half Japanese and half Filipino <a href=# rel=follow>businessman</a> Justin Hakuta. He is the son of inventor and TV personality Ken Hakuta.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Justin is a talented and strong-willed person who has worked in renowned companies like DIRECTV and Cargomatic Inc. Currently, he is working at GoodRx, a company that helps track drug prices and coupons for pharmacies.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The pair met at a wedding reception of mutual friends back in 2010. Wong was instantly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">impressed by Justin</a>, but it took a while for the business executive to reciprocate it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He attended one of Wong’s standup shows and was eventually captivated by her. Regardless, the couple took their relationship slow.&nbsp;The pair are very supportive of one another.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Wong paid off her beau’s student debt of $70,000 from Harvard Business School, and Justin always checks on Wong’s jokes before she delivers them to the audience.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They got married in 2014, and soon after, Wong was pregnant with <a href=# rel=follow>twins</a>. Unfortunately, the pregnancy ended up in a miscarriage. This took a toll on the couple who did drugs to cope up with the situation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In addition, Wong was worried about what other people and her in-laws would say about the situation.&nbsp;Later, everything turned out to be okay. Her husband, as well as his parents, were supportive of her. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The pair are living happily now with two daughters, Mari and Nikki.&nbsp;They constantly post about their parenthood journey on their Instagram, but they have not yet revealed their children’s faces.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Ali Wong’s Net Worth?</h2><p>After her success with stand-ups in 2011, she was invited to shows like John Oliver's New York Stand Up Show, Comedy Underground Show, and&nbsp;The Tonight Show.&nbsp;</p><p>She also dipped her toes in acting by starring in Are You There, Chelsea? In the past decade, Wong has worked on many TV shows, movies, and other ventures.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She has released two Netflix specials — Baby Cobra in 2015 and Hard Knock Wife in 2018. She has also written a book named Dear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets, and Advice for Living Your Best Life dedicated to her daughters.&nbsp;</p><p>To date, she has 33 credits as an actress and five credits as a writer, including her stand-up specials and the acclaimed series Fresh Off the Boat.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, Wong has amassed a massive net worth. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the actress has a whopping net worth of $3 million.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmcnnq4u82gZKmZopq7tb%2BMoaysmpGjsW6vx6KjnaqVo3qvsdNmrqiqpJ17qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./charlotte-austin-cz5h-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Charlotte Austin (Pageant Contestant) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./90-day-fiance-alum-nearly-dies-boyfriend-arrested-for-attempted.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>90 Day Fiance Alum Nearly Dies; Boyfriend Arrested for Attempted Murder</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
