exes were "not to harass" each other, The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal.</p><p>Axed <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> star <a href=#>TJ</a> is in the middle of his second divorce from his wife <a href=#>Marilee Fiebig</a> following his alleged affair with TV host <a href=#>Amy Robach</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/4a72cc73-72cb-448d-8c08-cc4106bb6332.jpg> <img

filed for divorce from him back in March 2007, according to documents exclusively obtained by The U.S. Sun.</p><p>In Ferson's <a href=#>divorce complaint</a>, she alleged that their <a href=#>marriage</a> was "irretrievably broken" with there being "no reasonable hope for reconciliation."</p><p>In her filing, she said they separated in October 2006, shortly after they had moved to <a href=#>Georgia</a>.</p><p>Notably, their separation began the same month TJ got his first <a href=#>major career break</a> when he joined the ranks at CNN as an anchor and correspondent.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More Amy & TJ">Read More Amy & TJ</h2><p>He was previously working at the local news station KNTV, in <a href=#>San Francisco</a>.</p><p>In her divorce, Ferson demanded <a href=#>alimony support</a>, as she claimed she "earns insufficient funds for support."</p><p>It reads: "[The] Plaintiff is dependent upon the defendant for her temporary and permanent support and maintenance."</p><p>In the divorce, both TJ and Ferson state they have no children born of their marriage and are not expecting any.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Both TJ and Ferson agreed to the judge's order that neither will do any "threatening, injuring maltreating, vilifying, molesting or harassing the adverse party," as a result of the divorce.</p><p>The couple entered into a settlement agreement, which <a href=#>proved costly for TJ</a>.</p><p>Ferson was awarded monthly alimony payments of $2,000 over the course of three years.</p><p>She was also given $25,000 out of their $30,000 joint savings account, and he had to pay the $3,500 balance of a shared credit card.</p><p>TJ was also ordered to pay the remainder of her lease on her <a href=#>BMW</a>, as well as provide her with ongoing <a href=#>health</a> care through his employer over the course of several years.&nbsp;</p><p>In total, TJ's divorce from Ferson cost upwards of $100,000.</p><p>He did, however, get to keep their home in Georgia, and Ferson moved back to her home state of <a href=#>Missouri</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The divorce from Ferson was finalized in June of 2007.</p><p>TJ <a href=#>filed for divorce from his second wife</a> Marilee Fiebig in late December.&nbsp;</p><h2>ANOTHER NASTY DIVORCE</h2><p>The U.S. Sun previously exclusively revealed that <a href=#>Marilee</a> had brought on a second power-house attorney, Fara Rodriguez - who recently made partner at her firm Philips Nizer LLP in Manhattan.</p><p>Meanwhile, a legal expert has claimed that TJ's alleged affairs can <a href=#>impact his custody case</a> if a court finds that the person's extramarital relationship impacted their ability to parent.</p><p>Lisa Zeiderman, a <a href=#>New York</a> divorce attorney and partner at Miller Zeiderman, said that one of the questions that might be examined in a custody case such as TJ's - which came with so much press coverage - is examining the impact a <a href=#>high-profile alleged affair</a> could have on a child.</p><p>"This lack of privacy, and the degree to which a parent has contributed to that lack of privacy, I don't think would be helpful in a custody case."</p><p>The expert expanded on how an affair may impact a child, <a href=#>such as Sabine</a>, who recently <a href=#>celebrated her 10th birthday</a>.</p><p>Lisa said some of the questions that could come up in court could include: "How did that relationship affect their ability to parent?</p><p>"Did they make choices to be with the person they have these extramarital affairs with at times that they could have been with their children?"</p><p>In addition to that, the court will also look at the bottom line, if <a href=#>money was spent on an alleged affair</a> that should have been earmarked for one's family.</p><p>"There is also the question of equitable distribution, or what we call a wasteful dissipation of assets," Lisa added.</p><p>"The question becomes: Because of your affair were you wastefully dissipating assets?</p><p>"Were you paying for things, gifts, extravagant luxury things, and that kind of stuff, and does that need to go back into the marital pie?"</p><h2>'<strong>AMY & TJ ARE OUT'</strong></h2><p>Late last month, a source told The U.S. Sun that Amy and TJ's exit <a href=#>had become official at ABC</a>, after meditation sessions with the network ended and a deal was reached.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's official. Amy and TJ are out at the network. They reached a deal a few minutes ago," the source said.</p><p>An ABC News spokesperson added: “After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and TJ Holmes about different options, we all agreed it’s best for everyone that they move on from ABC News.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions.”</p><p>The popular hosts had been missing from the show since November 2022, when their <a href=#>alleged affair was revealed</a> and the two were placed on a <a href=#>temporary hiatus</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/gma-host-tj-holmes-ex-790872323.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/amy-robach-reports-live-one-754330855.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/33d6e3ef-d309-4f87-bd17-01ea6f881009.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvY2l%2BeICWaKujZZikua6x0maboq6fp7CmecCmsGaelafAsLqMoZirmaOouqa602g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-mom-dad-cars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner Shows Off New 'Mom and Dad' Cars</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./geri-hirsch-19830727-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Geri Hirsch (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
