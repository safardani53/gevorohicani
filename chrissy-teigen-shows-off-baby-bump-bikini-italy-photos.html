In other photos, her 4-year-old son, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miles</strong></a>, stood in front of her while playing on his Nintendo Switch as Chrissy scrolled through her phone, while her daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Luna</strong></a>, 6, looked excited to show her parents her fashion magazine.

She also talked about how nervous she is to get bad news with every doctor appointment, making it harder to let her pregnancy be publicly known. “I don’t think I’ll ever walk out of an appointment with more excitement than nerves but so far, everything is perfect and beautiful and I’m feeling hopeful and amazing,” she continued. “Ok phew it’s been very hard keeping this in for so long!” Hopefully, the family trip to Italy can help put her worries at ease.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FyZpygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjerS0zrCqZqeWm3qjrcGyZJutnaV6o7XKoqWiZZmprq3FjKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./larry-birkhead-occupation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Larry Birkhead's Occupation?
