Paige has gone viral on <a href=#>TikTok</a> thanks to a video of her looking remarkably like Ariana as she walks down the runway at the Creators Inc. x Bossi show as part of New York Fashion Week.</p><p>"Fake Ariana came bouncing out on the runway," the caption under the video reads. As the video makes evident, Paige doesn't look totally comfortable walking the runway, or is at the very least doing an uncanny impression of Ariana Grande. Following the video's virality, though, many want to learn more about who exactly Paige is.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Ariana Grande look alike Paige Niemann?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Paige is known to fans of Ariana Grande thanks to her obsession with recreating many of the singer's most iconic looks. As of this writing, Paige has a following of almost 800,000 people on Instagram, where she regularly posts images that bear an uncanny resemblance to Ariana. She also has a following of more than 10 million on TikTok (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@paigeniemann</a>), and frequently posts videos about Ariana on that platform as well.</p><p>Paige came under fire last year for content that she posted on her OnlyFans in which she was posing in a NSFW and revealing more than the real singer ever would while looking quite a bit like her. Fans at the time called the move disrespectful, in part because they felt that Paige was constantly trying to resemble Ariana in the photos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ariana Grande is also dealing with music leaks from someone named Adriana Venti.</h2><p>Although Ariana isn't trying to make headlines right now, her name is coming up in the news quite a bit. Between her look alike posing at New York Fashion Week and a leak of her track "Fantasize" hitting Spotify in the Philippines, she's everywhere.</p><p>The song was pulled from Spotify after receiving more than 70,000 streams, and it was uploaded by someone named Adriana Venti, who is obviously using a pseudonym that resembles the singer's actual name.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>The track's official name appears to be "Fantasize," but it was uploaded under the title "But Just Before I Go, There's Something You Should Know" on Aug. 19, 2023, and was released by YUH Records. The identity of the leaker is a mystery, but the track has now been pulled down by Spotify.</p><p>Ariana has had music leaks before, but between a look alike stealing her signature high pony and people leaking her music, it seems like the singer is just jumping from issue to issue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bqrc2aZKCqkaOxpnnLqKakZZGhtqyxjKmYop%2BVYruqscyapac%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-kruse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Kruse</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kardashian-fans-suspect-kim-secretly-dating-la-lakers-player.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kardashian fans suspect Kim, 42, is secretly dating LA Lakers player Lonnie Walker, 24, after spotti</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
