His parents are <strong>Otis Gilmore</strong> and <strong>Mattie Lou Gilmore</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The former basketballer comes from a very struggling and hard-working family. Gilmore’s father was a fisherman, while his mother looked after him and his nine siblings.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a fisherman, Otis did not have a stable job. Hence, the Gilmore family struggled financially.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Being the second oldest, the financial struggles in his family wrapped up his childhood pretty early.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nevertheless, the optimistic and hard-working player considered himself blessed.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bulls-Player-Artis-Gilmore.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, he was grateful to his parents for giving their best to provide for him and his siblings.
