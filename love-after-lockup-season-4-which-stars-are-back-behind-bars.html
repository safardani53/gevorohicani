reality shows.</p><p>A Real Housewife might get a glass of wine thrown in her face if she steps out of line, but a Lockup star could wind up back behind bars.</p><p>The recidivism rate is sky high in this country, and LAL producers tend not to cast the most stable members of the inmate community.</p><p>That means, of course, that there’s a very good chance that your favorite Lockup star will be back in the slammer before their season even ends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And in many of those cases, the re-incarcerated star will never return to television, which means you might be left forever wondering what happened to them.</p><p>Fortunately, the folks at Starcasm have devoted many research hours to <a href=#>determining the fate of the men and women</a> who starred in Love After Lockup Season 4.</p><p>And you might not be surprised to learn that the show’s most recent cast hasn’t shown themselves to be very adept at staying out of jail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>So without further ado, we present to you the Love After Lockup Season 4 dishonor roll:</p><p>First up is the famously short-fused Lindsey Downs.</p><p>While many Season 4 stars have been arrested again, Lindsey is the only one who’s currently back behind bars — and yes, her anger played a role in her arrest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“A few days after I had moved out, Scott called and made a police report on the damages done to the house,” Lindsey told Starcasm from behind bars.</p><p>“He claimed I had damaged the desk, laptop, coffee pot, printer, and Xbox. As viewers can attest to after viewing the show, I didn’t touch the printer or Xbox, but Scott had to get the cost of damages up to a specific amount for the charge to be considered a felony.”</p><p>Lindsey was able to post bail for those charges, but her troubles were just beginning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She was arrested again shortly thereafter — on the same charges.</p><p>"Almost a month later, on July 8th, I was arrested again in Alcorn County on the same charge that I was already out on bond for,” she said.</p><p>“I was told afterwards it was an invalid warrant and I shouldn’t have been picked up."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Unfortunately, that invalid warrant led to the discovery of meth and a gun, which were both found in the 2017 BMW that Lindsey was "test driving" at the time.</p><p>She’s already been sentenced to 24 months, with multiple charges (&nbsp;firearm possession, meth possession, and malicious mischief)&nbsp;still pending.</p><p>So yeah, it may be a while before you see Lindsey again — and Dylan Smith might not fare much better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Dylan only appeared on the show briefly, as the newly-sprung boyfriend of Heather, who started making his life more difficult the very moment that he became a free man.</p><p>He seemed to have a promising future (when it comes to drug charges, dealers tend to fare better than users post-prison), but alas, it seems that Dylan couldn’t leave his past behind him.</p><p>He was arrested on December 10, but since Cook County, Illinois doesn’t allow private access to criminal records, his fate is unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But yeah, it doesn’t sound good.</p><p>“Prosecutors said police found a loaded 9-millimeter handgun, an 8-millimeter handgun with a bullet jammed in the barrel, 40 Ritalin pills, crack, heroin, Adderall, and a bag of pills that are believed to be Xanax,” one court filing read.</p><p>Next up is the the aptly-named Destinie Folsom — and yes, it does seem that prison is her fate. Get it?!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Destinie’s return to prison for a parole violation was documented on the show, but amazingly, she’s back on the streets.</p><p>Folsom was released from custody on August 27, so if you have any rich uncles who might be vulnerable to falling for a tatted-up con artist, you might want to keep an eye on them.</p><p>Moving on, we already reported that <a href=#>Maurice Gipson was arrested on shoplifting charges</a>, and it sounds like his situation is about to get a whole lot worse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Maurice was already on probation for a recent gun charge when he was taken into custody on October 13.</p><p>He’s out on bail, but he probably won’t be a free man for very long.</p><p>His next court date is scheduled for December 13, and it’s very unlikely that he’ll walk out of there without cuffs on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So yeah, a lot of bad news so far, but things might be looking up for Kristianna Roth!</p><p>Roth married John in a traditional Native American ceremony as soon as she walked out of prison, but unfortunately, she’s experienced a lot of ups and downs in the years.</p><p>During her time on the show, she went back to the clink for a probation violation — which is when Kristianna’s sister seized the opportunity to try and bang her husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>These days, however, it seems that Kristianna is clean and sober and keeping on the straight and narrow!</p><p>Look, at the end of the day it’s not easy for anyone to rebuild their life after spending time in prison.</p><p>We deeply sympathize with those who have continued to struggle, and we offer our most sincere congratulations to those who have managed to turn things around, a list that includes:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Chanda Curls, who bolted out of the bus station after seeing Tyrice’s electric blue suit and has managed to keep her nose clean ever since.</p><p>Quaylon Adams, whose relationship with Shavel was one of the messiest ever featured on the show, but who has managed to stay out of trouble ever since his release.</p><p>That’s no easy feat after getting locked up at 17!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hopefully, Chanda and Quaylon can stay on the right path, and their co-stars will find that path eventually.</p><p>We have faith in all of you, and a legion of fans are rooting for you!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper
