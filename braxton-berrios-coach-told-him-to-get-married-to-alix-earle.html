In particular, Berrios’ coach, <a href=#><strong>Mike McDaniel</strong></a>, “loves to chirp” about the couple, the wide receiver said during a recent episode of FanDuel TV’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Up & Adams Show With Kay Adams</a>.</p><p>“There is some real estate, at least in his mind, to throw around [whatever] he wants of that. Absolutely,” Berrios shared, noting that the coach has yet to work Earle into one of the team’s play calls.</p><p>When it comes to the advice McDaniel, 40, has given him about dating the TikTok star, Berrios joked that his coach’s words are “more satire than actual advice.” He continued: “Supposedly, [Mike] is very comfortable and confident about his game of getting his wife. That absolutely has been portrayed to me, but there’s not much advice.” (McDaniel wed <strong>Katie Hemstalk</strong> in 2014, and the pair welcomed their daughter, Alya June, in 2020.)</p><p>According to Berrios, McDaniel recently encouraged him to take the next step in his and Earle’s relationship. “Today, he told me, ‘Get married. Everything gets better,’ so I guess that is a little bit of advice, randomly, not even in context,” the athlete revealed.</p><p>When host <strong>Kay Adams</strong> asked whether Berrios and Earle plan to walk down the aisle in the near future, Berrios quickly shut down the speculation. “You asked if he gives advice,” he quipped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Braxton-Berrios-Was-Told-to-Get-Married-by-NFL-Coach-Mike-McDaniel-Amid-His-Alix-Earle-Romance3.jpg><p>Berrios and Earle have been <a href=#>romantically linked</a> since early this year. The two met at a Gatsby-themed party in Miami in February, one month after Berrios ended his two-year relationship with <strong>Sophia Culpo</strong>. Culpo, 27, has since implied that they <a href=#>broke up</a> because Berrios <a href=#>cheated on her</a> with Earle.</p><p>Berrios and Earle have continued to grow close, as Berrios attended Earle’s University of Miami graduation in May before they hung out together at a Hamptons music festival the following month.</p><p>In June, Berrios <a href=#>denied Culpo’s cheating claims</a> via his Instagram Story. “I was in a healthy relationship for two years. It was a good relationship, it was a healthy one and towards the end of it we had conversations along the lines of ‘we weren’t working out,” he said. “So, when we split back in January, that’s why.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Braxton-Berrios-Was-Told-to-Get-Married-by-NFL-Coach-Mike-McDaniel-Amid-His-Alix-Earle-Romance4.jpg><p>Berrios and Earle made their <a href=#>red carpet debut</a> at the <a href=#>2023 ESPYs</a> in June, though Earle clarified that they were still not officially a couple during a September interview on the “Just Friends?” podcast.</p><p>Last month, Earle confirmed her and Berrios’ relationship status at a live taping of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast in Chicago. “We’ve gotta ask the question and get to the tea right here, in the building tonight. Alix, do you have a boyfriend?” host <strong>Alex Cooper</strong> asked. Earle replied, “I mean, yes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpGtwbC6jJucq6qZpMBur86amqFlpKS5pXnHoqRmrJ9itKbAjKaYq6qZmrFuwM5mmKWhqGKyor7LnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cher-reflects-late-mother-georgia-holt-final-moments-so-much-pain.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cher Reflects on Late Mother Georgia Holt's Final Moments</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tylar-witt-pleads-guilty-to-murder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tylar Witt Pleads Guilty to Murder</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
