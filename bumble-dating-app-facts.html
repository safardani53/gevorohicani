This feature was created to inspire women to make the first move, to give them more power on the app and to prevent them from being bombarded with messages from men.</p><p>The match expires after 24 hours, but men can extend the window for an additional 24 hours if they pay a fee.</p><h2>Is Bumble free?</h2><h3>It is free, but there are paid features and perks</h3><p>There is no sign-up fee for the app.</p><p>However, there are some extra features such as being able to swipe through the profiles that have already liked you for a fee.</p><p>Also, men can pay for an additional 24 hours to see if their match will send them a message.</p><p>There is also a Rematch feature that will have potential suitors pop up after not matching the first time to try and get them to match again.</p><h3>It’s not just for heterosexual couples</h3><p>The app does not require you to define your sexuality.</p><p>It asks if you are interested in men, women or both.</p><p>If your preference isn’t a female/male match, the app allows either person to message first.</p><h3>The profile can be verified</h3><p>Bumble has a feature to verify daters by having them take a picture doing a certain motion to prove it is them.</p><p>The app then adds a check mark to the profile to show potential matches that they are real people.</p><p>It is to prevent internet bots and people from catfishing others.</p><h3>Bumble isn’t just for dating</h3><p>The app also has features to help you find friends and to network.</p><p>By switching the app to BFF mode it provides the user with people of the same sex that Bumble thinks will make a good friendship.</p><p>Bumble Bizz allows the user to network and build their careers.</p><h2>Do celebrities use Bumble?</h2><p>You would think that celebs would have no problem getting dates, but it seems they have been taken in by dating apps just like the rest of us.</p><p><a href=#>Made in Chelsea's Jamie Laing was once spotted on Bumble</a> following his split from cheating girlfriend Frankie Gaff.</p><p>He's now happily in a relationship with costar Sophie Habboo.</p><p>Actress Sharon Stone once got blocked from Bumble because her profile was reported as fake.</p><p>The former fashion model tweeted about her dilemma by stating: "<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">I went on the</span></p><p><span class=r-18u37iz>@bumble </span>dating sight and they closed my account.
