At every level he played, he shone brighter and was a winner.</strong></p><p>On 10 February 2023, he attended NFL Honors Award ceremony and shared his views on what it means to win a Super Bowl.</p><p>He is one of the most decorated NFL players and a Super Bowl winner with the Cowboys.</p><p>Tony has been a big football fan since he was a kid. His interest in the sport increased with time, and he played football at high school and college.</p><p>Eventually, he entered the 1977 NFL Draft and had a very successful career. He is regarded as one of the best running backs in NFL history.</p><p>On top of that, his son Anthony made appearances in 1999 and 2002 with the Raiders. Furthermore, he is the uncle of the former football cornerback Ty Law.</p><p>Ty Law is a three-time Super Bowl Champion with the New England Patriots.</p><p>So, today in this article, learn more about Tony’s life. Here we have mentioned all his details regarding his early life, family, professional career, net worth, personal life, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>But, before getting into details about the legendary NFL running back’s life and career, look at some quick facts about him.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Early Life, Family, & Education</span></h2><p>Anthony Drew Dorsett, popularly known as Tony Dorsett, was born in Rochester, Pennsylvania, to Wes Dorsett and Myrtle Dorsett on 7 April 1954.</p><p>The NFL player’s father was a steel mill worker, while his mother was a housewife and cared for the kids.</p><p>Dorsett’s family resided in a government-funded project called Plan 11. Although they weren’t financially gifted, the family was happy with what they had.</p><p>Moreover, they counted their blessing and kept their faith in God. The NFL player grew up with six siblings.</p><p>There isn’t much information about them. Nevertheless, his elder brothers were excellent athletes who played football and ran track.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tony-Dorsett-With-His-Mother-Myrtle-.jpg></p><p>Hence, his siblings served as a source of inspiration for Anthony to pursue football. He also played high school football with them at Hopewell High School.</p><p>Besides that, the athlete practiced a lot and worked hard to improve his skills. The former Bronco was determined to make a better life than he had, so he never gave up.</p><p>Shortly after, he was well-known as one of the best cornerbacks and linebackers.&nbsp;</p><p>Tony was equally good at basketball. He joined the University of Pittsburg after graduating high school in 1972.</p><p>The football player continually raises awareness against a sleep disorder called Sleep Apnea. The disease causes breathing stops or shallow breathing more than often.</p><p>As a result, regular sleep routines are disrupted, leading to sleepiness and fatigue. Dorsett has helped over 150 former footballers overcome this disorder.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Age, Height, & Weight</span></h2><p>The former athlete is 69 years old as of 2023.

Dorsett’s coaches had second guesses about him as he weighed only 143 lb.</p><p>He quickly turned them into fans with his exceptional defensive skills. At the end of his second year, he made 19 touchdowns.</p><p>Besides that, he was a two-time All-State selection. He was one of the most prominent Vikings players and received well-deserved attention.</p><p>Tony suffered a concussion in his senior year, but it didn’t affect his playing career with the school team.</p><p>Later, he assisted the team in the Big 33 Football Classic. On top of retiring his jersey, Hopewell’s stadium was renamed Tony Dorsett Stadium.</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>College Career</span></h3><p>Following a successful high school football career, Tony attended the University of Pittsburgh.

Nonetheless, he still rushed 748 yards for the 10th season continuously.</p><p>In the next season, he was the Cowboys’ primary running back. Hence, he started six of the 12 games he played while rushing 456 yards.</p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Denver Broncos</span></h3><p>Anthony Sr. demanded a trade after he was benched in two games despite being fit to play.
