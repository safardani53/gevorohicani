The desire to make my Chickasaw tribe and my state of Oklahoma proud.</p><p>"As a perfectionist…as someone who tries harder than ANYONE WILL EVER KNOW to nail everything I do… having to feel like I failed in front of everyone is hard enough without people pointing at my hardest performance as proof I never belonged here; as 'proof' I can’t sing; using it to gloat and say 'finally she’s gone'…</p><p>"So please… y’all who are messaging and emailing me such evil and deflating things… stop," the singer wrote.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Nini Iris shares message after her elimination</h3><p>Top 9 contestant Nini Iris took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> after being eliminated from the show Tuesday night to share a video message for her fans.</p><p>"Hey beautiful people," the Georgian singer said in the <a href=# aria-label="post (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p><p>"I wanted to thank each and every one of you for voting for me.
