Based on the ongoing <a href=#>manga</a> series by Gege Akutami, the anime comes from <a href=#>MAPPA</a> Studio and first premiered back in October 2020. The series quickly became one of the most popular anime of the season and was even named "Anime of the Year" at the 5th Annual <a href=#>Crunchyroll Anime Awards</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though the series has been followed up with a massively successful prequel film that was released to commercial success in both Japan and in limited worldwide theatrical releases, the actual weekly series has not seen a continuation since the first season ended back in March of 2021. As of now, however, Jujutsu Kaisen is set to return with all-new episodes in 2023. Here's everything you should know about Season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen, including its release date.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is the release date for 'Jujutsu Kaisen' Season 2?</h2><p>Jujutsi Kaisen follows high school student <a href=#>Yuji Itadori</a>. After becoming the host of a powerful Cursed Spirit named Ryomen Sukuna, Yuji is brought into custody by an organization of Jujutsu sorcerers. Though they plan to exorcise Sukuna in a ritual that will kill Yuji, Yuji's ability to retain his humanity and keep Sukuna prompts one of the higher-ups to keep him alive. He then trains alongside other up-and-coming sorcerers to fight other Curses while finding a way to safely sever Yuji's connection with Sukuna.</p><p>The first season aired with 24 episodes between October 2020 and March 2021. It was followed by <a href=#>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</a>, a prequel movie that follows some of the sorcerers who would go on to train Yuji and his friends. Though the film came out in December 2021, news about a second season for the anime wouldn't come until several months later in February 2022.</p><p>By then, it was officially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a> that Season 2 would be coming out. More than a year later, new episodes are officially on the horizon.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen is set to premiere on July 6. Like its predecessor, it will run for approximately 24 episodes across six months. Reportedly, the new episodes will adapt the "Kaigyoku/Gyokusetsu" arc as well as the "Shibuya Incident arc."</p><p>The series will likely stream on <a href=#>Crunchyroll</a>, where both the first season and the film can already be streamed.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Jujutsu Kaisen' Season 2 out on Netflix?</h2><p>Crunchyroll is your best bet to watch both new and old episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen. As of this writing, the series is not available on <a href=#>Netflix</a> in the US, nor is it likely to receive Season 2 when it begins airing. Netflix tends to employ odd release schedules with their anime content as well, either opting to release them as full-season batches several months after their Japanese broadcast or as weekly releases two weeks after they premiere in Japan.</p><p>Either way, fans will want to keep their eyes peeled for new episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen, starting on July 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn8KrwdOsrGajkZ7AprqMrJyaq5%2BjenN50Z6jnpmjmnqlrdOe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-zapata-19560731-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Laura Zapata (Soap Opera Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-gwyneth-paltrows-bachelorette-party-trip-to-cabo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Gwyneth Paltrows Bachelorette Party Trip to Cabo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
