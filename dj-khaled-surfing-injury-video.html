He completely wiped out and seemingly did a belly flop on the edge of the board before it popped up violently out of the water, as seen below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The video of his accident followed a clip Khaled<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> posted from a massage table</a> in which he gave more insight into the ordeal. “So I’m getting a message right now because I hurt myself yesterday surfing … flying through the sky, hitting the board on my rib. Bellyflopping in the water,” he began. “I’m in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>so much pain</a>. I tried to golf this morning. I played, I made it to the eighth hole and I stopped myself because I know I’m gonna every day.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I called a doctor … just to look and make sure it ain’t nothing serious,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>father of two</a> continued as his massage was in progress. “My masseuse is saying it’s just the muscle,” he added. “She feels the muscle really irritated and disturbed in that area but now it’s like, it’s affecting the process of the progress and I can’t have that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>He let fans know that he felt the need to update them because he was “depressed leaving the golf course.” Khaled continued, “I gotta be smart so I can play every other day. … I don’t wanna hurt myself and not be able to play golf. I’ll be back on the course tomorrow. I promise you.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Sure enough, the “All I Do Is Win” rapper returned to the golf course and looked as good as new. However, that was far from the case. In <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>another video</a> he shared, Khaled talked to fans once more before getting an X-Ray taken. “I have golf seven days a week. It’s golf and studio seven days a week,” he explained with a sense of urgency, in disbelief that his injury was affecting him so much. He later confirmed to the doctor that he is “in the middle of making some incredible music” and has “some shoots” to complete. “I’m just hoping it’s just a bruised muscle or just a bruise. I wanna make sure the bone is not broken,” he added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>In his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>latest video</a>, shared on June 14, he revealed he denied a cat scan because he didn’t want to be in such a tight space. His video ended with a clip of him golfing, which had him excited and energized.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Khaled has been in Turks and Caicos since at least June 8, which is when he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared footage</a> of himself and his family flying to the gorgeous island in a private jet. He also confirmed he had some work to do in the studio. “FAN LUV I BEEN WORKING ON NEW ANTHEMS ! NEW MUISC ! NEW ENERGY ! NEW BLESSING ! TAKING THE STUDIO TO TURKS,” he enthusiastically captioned the video.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Khaled is no stranger to injuries caused by aquatic hobbies. In 2017, he cut his leg while trying to get his jetski dislodged from some branches that were in the water. He used the injury as a teachable moment. “I cut myself. The key is don’t panic,” he told fans in the Instagram clip he shared (seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>), which showed blood running down his leg. “This ain’t no joke, team. I ain’t panicking, I just got to figure it out. I am stuck in a tree in the ocean.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BtZp2iXaC1orjEnWSsraKbtq%2BzjKKlo62irnq3tcOepmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-10-episode-11-recap-tea-is.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tea Is Of The Essence</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mitch-marner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mitch Marner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
