The satirist’s cause of death has not yet been revealed, and his medical history is presently unknown.&nbsp;His representatives confirmed his death at the Pendean care facility in West Sussex, UK. Only family members will attend his burial, and a celebration of his life will take place in 2023.</p><p>On Twitter, his co-stars, notably impressionist Rory Bremner, paid homage and conveyed their condolences:</p><p>“I am really sorry to learn that the great John Bird has passed away. One of the most humble and gifted satirists of all time. And one of the few remaining anti-establishment cornerstones. 14”</p><p>Bird was well-known for his roles in TV series and films such as A Dandy in Aspic, This, That, and the Other, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, and others.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/John-Bird-1.jpg alt="John Bird" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Many TV series featured John Bird in main roles or as a guest star.</h2><p>John Michael Bird, born on November 22, 1936, began his career on television in the 1960s. He appeared in series such as That Was The Week That Was, A Very Peculiar Practice, My Father Knew Lloyd George, and others. He was most recognized for his role as Mr. Rembrandt in The Melting Pot, a BBC comedy series. The pilot episode of the program aired in June 1976, and although the complete series was filmed, the other episodes were never published. The reason for the show’s cancellation was never revealed, however, actor and comedian Spike Milligan claimed that it was probably terminated because it wasn’t very humorous.</p><p>Bird played Raymond in an episode of the BBC anthology series Play for Today’s ninth season. From October 15, 1970, until August 28, 1984, the program broadcasted 306 episodes. The show was also embroiled in a few squabbles. Yes, Prime Minister and Joint Account were two other programs in which the actor appeared. He played Jack Ormand in an episode of the Granada TV series Travelling Man and starred in a performance of King Lear.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/John-Bird-2.jpg alt="John Bird" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bird was most recognized for his roles in comedies, although he was cast in the ITV criminal drama comedy series El C.I.D. The tone of the program was more serious than in most of his earlier appearances. He appeared as a guest star on episodes such as Jonathan Creek and One Foot in the Grave. He was also noted for his roles in To Play the King, Absolute Power, and other films.</p><h2>Twitter users pay tribute</h2><p>John Bird rose to prominence as a result of his many appearances in films and television shows.
