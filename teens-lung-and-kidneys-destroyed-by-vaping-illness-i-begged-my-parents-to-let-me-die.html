Doctors fought to keep his inflamed lungs from collapsing and his organs from shutting down. “I begged my parents to let me die,” says Walker. “I wouldn’t wish this on anybody.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“His case is the worst I’ve seen so far,” recalls critical care specialist Dr. Charles Hunley with Orlando’s Regional Medical Center, which has treated six <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vaping-related cases</a> in recent months. “Walker was literally dying in front of our eyes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Described by CDC officials as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an “alarming epidemic”</a> that has left 2,290 people with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lung injuries</a> and has been linked to 47 deaths, according to the agency’s figures. “No youth, young person or pregnant women should be using any e-cigarette or vaping product,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC tells PEOPLE. “Lung injury associated with e-cigarette or vaping product use is serious and potentially fatal.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Walker admits that he was oblivious to the potential <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dangers of vaping</a> last December when he purchased his first Juul device, along with a package of tiny mango-flavored pods that contained a pack of cigarette’s worth of liquid nicotine, at a gas station near his parent’s home in Orlando.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“After about a week and a half I stopped getting buzzed from it,” he recalls, “but I’d get nervous and twitchy if I didn’t have it.” For the next three months, Walker tried convincing himself that “if I want to give it up, I’ll just give it up. But by then I was hooked on it just like everyone else.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By early March, Walker couldn’t hold any food down and had fevers and chills. Doctors at the emergency room near the Florida Atlantic University campus told him he had the flu and prescribed antibiotics and steroids. Four days later, his condition worsened.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My chest hurt so bad I couldn’t even see straight,” says Walker, who managed to drive himself 200 miles back to his parents’ home in Orlando. “I’d never seen anyone so sick in all my life,” says his father Dave, who rushed his son to a nearby urgent care clinic. Doctors insisted that he needed to go to a hospital emergency room where x-rays quickly revealed that he had what appeared to be pneumonia in his left lung—and he was immediately admitted to ICU. “No one asked me if I vaped,” recalls Walker. “They just asked me if I smoked and I told them I didn’t.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Within days, he was connected to a respirator, then airlifted to another hospital, put in a medically-induced coma and hooked up to ECMO machine that pumped and oxygenated his blood outside of his body, allowing his lungs and heart to rest. “We lost him five times,” recalls his mom, Candy, who works as a critical care nurse. Doctors eventually determined that his infection was caused by adenovirus—often found in college dorms that normally only leads to a mild illness—but they were stumped over how this could happen to an otherwise healthy college athlete.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The answer came into focus after Walker’s parents went to clean out his dorm room and were horrified by what they found. “I opened up his desk drawer and it was filled with Juul pods,” recalls Dave. When Candy relayed the information about her son’s vaping habits to his physicians, it solved the mystery of why Walker’s lungs had become so weak that a relatively benign virus could nearly kill him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Walker left the hospital in July, he had lost 80 lbs., and his left lung and both his kidneys were destroyed. He carries an oxygen tank with him wherever he goes, and will have to endure grueling lung and kidney transplants to survive (The McKnights are raising money for his medical bills <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>on GoFundMe</a>). Now at 20 years old, Walker’s life revolves around dialysis sessions, physical therapy, doctors’ appointments and twice-a-day naps. “This is like something I used to think only happened in the movies,” he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more of Walker McKnight’s story, pick up a copy of PEOPLE, on newsstands Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2irnp2eqHqtwc2gZJqmlGK4qrDNnrCsZZSawLW%2BzrKcnWWSrnq3rc%2BipaBlmaG5r7HSrGSiZZKatKixw2aksmWglr%2BmutOsZK2nXaGytXnMnmSdoZVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zachary-chin-fw1v-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zachary Chin (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-fishnet-dress-savage-x-fenty-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rihannas Fishnet Dress For Savage X Fenty Photo Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
