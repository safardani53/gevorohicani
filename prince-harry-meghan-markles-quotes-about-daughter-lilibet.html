His parents were “trying to give Archie all the attention he [could] handle” the insider said in April 2021, noting that the former military pilot and the <a href=#>Suits</a> alum were “a little worried” about transitioning from one kid to two.</p><p>Sure enough, Harry said during a July 2021 royal event with <a href=#><strong>Ed Sheeran</strong> </a>that two was “definitely a juggle.”</p><p>He and the former actress <a href=#>announced their pregnancy news</a> in February 2021, the same month that they made their royal exits permanent. “We can confirm that Archie is going to be a big brother,” a spokesperson for the pair told Us in a statement at the time. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to be expecting their second child.”</p><p>The reveal came nearly one year after the Los Angeles native <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage</a>. The Deal or No Deal alum wrote about the pregnancy loss in a November 2020 essay for The New York Times, writing, “After changing [Archie’s] diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right. I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meghan added at the time: “Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by a few. In being invited to share our pain, together we take the first steps toward healing.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to read her and the England native’s sweet quotes about their baby girl, from her “chilled” personality to <a href=#>the touching meaning behind her name</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkvbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6ecyenqGZnmK6or7KpZysZaGqvLWx0maYm6elqXqlrdSgn62domK5qrjIm5ytZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raven-symones-brother-blaize-dead-at-31-after-colon-cancer-battle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Raven-Symone's Brother Blaize Dead at 31 After Colon Cancer Battle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maura-higgins-new-teeth-braces.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maura Higgins reveals her new teeth after getting braces to widen her smile</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
