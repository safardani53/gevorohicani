"I feel like I’m saying this all the time, but you watch the show, and you watch the reason that I went on the show, because I live in the middle of nowhere, and there’s not a lot of women, so it’s hard to date."</p><p>Perhaps that's why he returned to the Bachelor pool looking for love.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Chris Soules dating now?</h2><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to the internet's reigning expert on all things Bachelor, Reality Steve, Chris has been shacked up with season 24 finalist Victoria Fuller for at least the past week.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>(EXCLUSIVE): One of the more random Bachelor “couples” that I can’t say I ever would’ve guessed.
