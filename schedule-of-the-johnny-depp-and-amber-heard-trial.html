The third week of the trial completed on Thursday, April 28, and the court will reconvene on Monday, May 2. The experiment is expected to last two to three weeks.</p><p>According to Deadline, Heard is expected to take the stand on Monday and might be a “very powerful weapon” in this case.</p><p>“It’s difficult to envision Amber not proving to be a tremendously powerful weapon against Depp in her own advocacy. Regardless matter how they try to portray her, she has been nothing but calm and conservative in court without saying a word.”</p><p>Depp’s team has already presented the case in court, as plaintiffs in civil lawsuits routinely do in the United States. They have yet to submit their final arguments. Meanwhile, Heard’s team will allegedly present their case as the defense team in the following weeks.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Johnny-Depp-1.jpg alt="Johnny Depp" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In addition to Depp and Heard, other A-list celebrities such as James Franco, Paul Bettany, Jason Momoa, and Elon Musk have been called as witnesses in the lawsuit. However, it is unclear if the celebrities would testify in person or by video recording in the coming days.&nbsp;Despite their names being on the witness list, none of the prominent individuals have been in court thus yet. According to rumors, the defamation trial will most certainly end on May 19, 2022.&nbsp;It will be suspended for a week between May 9 and 12, when Judge Penny Azcarate will be away for a pre-scheduled conference.</p><h2>Johnny Deep and Amber heard trial.</h2><p>The Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard defamation trial finished its third week on Thursday, April 29, 2022, with significant testimony from ACLU Chief Operating Officer Terence Dougherty, Depp’s business manager Edward White, his bodyguard Malcolm Connolly, and driver Starling Jenkins.&nbsp;The highly-publicized trial started on April 11, 2022, in Fairfax County, Virginia, and is expected to last three weeks. Depp has already completed his four-day testimony on the stand, saying that he was a victim of domestic violence during his relationship with Heard.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Johnny-Depp-3.jpg alt="Johnny Depp" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Meanwhile, Heard’s legal team claimed that their client was subjected to domestic violence at the hands of Depp. Both sides have disputed each other’s charges.&nbsp;According to several media outlets, Amber Heard’s evidence would most likely be heard within the next week of the trial. Unless there is a dramatic discovery during Depp’s team’s final arguments, the actress is expected to take the stand when the trial starts on Monday, May 2, 2022.</p><p></p><p>The defamation trial began with Heard’s 2018 Washington Post op-ed in which she depicted herself as a victim of domestic abuse. Although the piece did not identify Depp, his team claimed that it portrayed the actor as the accused abuser and had a detrimental influence on his career.&nbsp;Depp filed a $50 million libel claim against Heard, kicking off the defamation trial. Meanwhile, Heard countersued Depp for $100 million, alleging that he attacked her on many occasions throughout their relationship and one year of marriage. Depp has refuted her charges.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnKCVmcKtsYyonWasmJp6q7vHp6WyZZSavbF5wKebZpmdl7KzeceemKucXam%2Fqq3LaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tiny-home-salon-office.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I converted a shed into a tiny home for only $13,000 - it has a bathroom, electricity, and a cozy po</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-dana-carvey-left-hollywood.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Dana Carvey Says He Left Hollywood in the Late '90s</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
