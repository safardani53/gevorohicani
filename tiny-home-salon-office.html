There’s also a cozy porch you pass as you walk inside.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more about tiny homes">Read more about tiny homes</h2><p>Once you open the door, you’ll find an aesthetically pleasing waiting room with two chairs and a large sign.</p><p>Just a little past that, the tiny space includes a full bathroom with a door for privacy.</p><p>“I love it so much,” Samantha said. “My husband has done such a wonderful job.”</p><p>When you turn to the right, you’ll see a spacious area that includes a desk, couch chair, and salon chair.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>“Best thing I ever did,” the TikToker tells viewers.</p><p>The entire space is 14 by 36 square feet, so that means with a little creativity, you could also transform it entirely into your new home.</p><p>To fully transition the space into a home, you’d need to add in all the essentials for easy living: a bed, kitchen appliances, kitchen table, and perhaps a couch and TV.</p><p>And of course, to fully make it livable, you’ll also need to add in a plumbing, air conditioning, and heating.</p><p>While all these additions will cost you, it’s nowhere near the amount you’d spend on a typical American home, which ranges upwards from $300,000 on average.</p><p>Sheds of this size tend to sell for between $10,000 and $14,000, which means creating the tiny home space of your dreams would be far more affordable than taking on a home mortgage.</p><p>The U.S. Sun found a similar tiny shed for just $12,905 on <a

home journey, there are a few things you should know.</p><p>The spaces tend to save money on upfront costs and rent, but you’ll need to be involved in finding and building your unit.</p><p>The most common type of unit tends to be either a shed or an RV, and there are advantages to both.</p><p>While RVs give you the flexibility of traveling wherever you’d like, they sometimes are kicked off the property as they’re only allowed by law to be parked in certain spaces for temporary periods of time.</p><p>Sheds likewise require you to know your state and county’s zoning laws, as you typically won’t be able to fully live in a shed on someone else’s home property.</p><p>Even with these potential roadblocks, there are several financial pros if you decide to invest in a tiny home as well.</p><p>Some tiny homeowners have even turned their spaces into prime real estate.</p><p>They’re able to fully cover their own rent costs by charging others to stay in the tiny units.</p><p>Before you take the plunge into the tiny home world, though, you need to think through some decisions.</p><p>For one, consider where you will purchase one, or if you’d rather build one yourself.</p><p>The Home Depot regularly sells pre-designed tiny homes as sheds or RVs.</p><p>These spaces can provide you the ease of quick home delivery without having to worry about each specific design choice for your new home.</p><p>Generally, even with these types of sheds on sale, you’ll be responsible for adding all the required plumbing and electrical services to make your new home livable.</p><p>You’ll also need to ensure you have a space to put your tiny home.</p><p>This means you’ll likely need to search for land to rent.</p><p>Spaces are routinely put up for auction on sites like Facebook Marketplace.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>One couple transformed a <a href=#>$500 Facebook Marketplace
