He started playing the piano at a very young age, but spent most of his childhood away from music until his early twenties when he received a piano from his mother. He recorded a cover of Chris Brown's "Crawl" and in November 2009 uploaded the clip to YouTube. His popularity encouraged him to continue downloading covers, including a collection of songs from Drake's Take Care that were released on the same day as the album. On September 11, 2012 - his birthday - he released My Life, a mixtape featuring his first originals written with Cody Tarpley. The following year, he signed with Republic, the company redesigned and republished My Life. SoMo's debut album of the same name, largely produced by Mick Schultz, was released in April 2014 and ranked number six on the Billboard 200. My Life II, featuring Trey Songz in single "Hide & Freak", followed in September 2015 .</p><table class=wikibox readability=6.5><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>Joseph Anthony Somers-Morales</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>September 11, 1987, Austin, Texas, US</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Origin</td><td class=wk_value>Denison, Texas, US</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Genres</td><td class=wk_value>R&B</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Singer, songwriter</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Instruments</td><td class=wk_value>Vocals, piano, guitar</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>2000–present</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Labels</td><td class=wk_value>Republic</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Associated acts</td><td class=wk_value>Mick Schultz, Jeremih, Tricky Stewart, Maty Noyes</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/somo-knnw-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>R&B Singer SoMo was born in Austin, Texas, United States on September 11, 1987.
