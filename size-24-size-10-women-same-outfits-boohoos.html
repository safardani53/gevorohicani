they each tried on the abstract plisse cowl neck midi dress from Boohoo to start.</p><p>The colourful number looked stunning on all the girls however for the smaller girls the dress fitted a lot tighter compared to Natasha's.</p><p>Debbie said: "All of ours look tight on us, and yours looks so good, if you're plus size it's true to size."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE FASHION STORIES">READ MORE FASHION STORIES</h2><p>For some of the women, the dress was so difficult to get into they revealed they wouldn't wear it again.</p><p>Next was a two toned knitted rib jumper and flared leggings set in green.</p><p>Debbi said it looked true to size but once the girls tried it on, not everyone was impressed by the two-piece set.</p><p>Debbie added: "It looks frumpy," while her friend's admitted it would look better if the top was cropped.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Natasha added that she would wear a white corset top with the trousers, which was a favourite with everyone.</p><p>They also tried an orange chiffon shirt with a twist detail in the centre - and it was a clear winner for all of the girls.</p><p>Deborah loved the fit of the shirt and Natasha liked the fact it covered her belly but had to size up to a 26 instead of her usual size 24.</p><p>The girls all grabbed some nude leggings as well, but Debbie pointed out straight away that the quality of the fabric felt bad.</p><p>"It's really thin so I feel like you'll be able to see whatever underwear your wearing through it, I like the design nevertheless," she said.</p><p>Debbie and Natasha found the leggings to be on the smaller size and recommended sizing up if you plan to buy it, but Deborah and Dee Dee both loved the leggings.</p><p>The girls also tried on an abstract pink copped shirt with a tie detail at the front.</p><p>The wrap-around top was a hit with all the women and Natasha added: It's a very mum fit, it's sexy but it's not too much."</p><p>The final item the girls got was a pink swimsuit with a belted waist and scooped back.</p><p>None of the girls were a fan of the swimsuit claiming it didn't look nice on their chest, and Natasha's didn't fit.</p><p>The video has already attracted over 8.000 views and people quickly took to the comments to share their thoughts.</p><p>One wrote: "The rainbow dress is so spring summer."</p><p>Another person commented: "That pink cropped shirt looked awesome on every one of you. It was so flattering and feminine!"</p><p>"The orange was my fave," penned a third.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Meanwhile, a fourth added: "The green set is giving prisoners."</p><p>"My fave was the pink wrap top," claimed a fifth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/i-m-size-24-friends-805945907.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/i-m-size-24-friends-805945915.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Fqb21wZ2yFcL%2FIs5xmamRiwKrGxGZoaWWnpLqmuoysmKadXaTCtbLIrapmmp%2BktbC70mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ava-phillippe-reese-witherspoon-daughter-3624966.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Ava Phillippe?
