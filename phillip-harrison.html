His son, Shaquille O'Neal is one of the most legendary basketball players of all time.&nbsp;</p><h2>Inside Late Phillip Harrison's Blissful Married Life</h2><p>Phillip was a man of many talents. He was an Army drill sergeant, a savvy investor, and a loving husband. He was also the stepfather of NBA star <a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal</a>, and it was through him that Shaq learned the importance of self-discipline, financial responsibility, and providing for his family.</p><p>Phillip Harrison married <strong>Lucille O'Neal,</strong> Shaquille's mother when the future millionaire was only two years old. From a very young age, Phillip taught Shaq the importance of self-discipline and hard work. He was known to "come into class and whoop" Shaq in front of everyone, but Shaq believes that this approach worked and helped him become the dominant player he was.</p><img id=postimg title=Late src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famousstardom.com/uploads/2023/05/17/late-phillip-harrison-wife-lucille-o-neal-and-their-son-shaquille-o-neal--1684300687.jpg alt=Late width=480 height=480 ezimgfmt="ng ngcb1 src" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span class=imageCaption>Late Phillip Harrison's wife Lucille O'Neal and their son Shaquille O'Neal.<br></span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Instagram (@shaq)</span></p><p>Phillip was also a savvy investor, and he taught Shaq the importance of being smart with his money. He always pointed out when Shaq was spending too much or making foolish investments, and he encouraged him to save and invest his money wisely. This advice paid off, as Shaq made a wise investment in Google back in 1999, years before the company became what it is today.</p><p>Phillip was also a loving husband. He and Lucille were married for over 30 years, and he was a devoted father to Shaq and his siblings. Phillip's death in 2013 was a significant loss to the family, but he left behind a legacy of love and financial wisdom that Shaq continues to carry on.</p><h3>Phillip Harrison's Son Shaquille O'Neal's Inspiring Married Life</h3><p>Phillip Harrison's son, Shaquille O'Neal is a legendary NBA player who has had an incredible career and an inspiring married life.

In 2006, the couple welcomed their third child, a son named <strong>Shaqir Rashaun</strong>. Just hours after Shaq played in an NBA playoff game against the Chicago Bulls, he rushed back to Miami to witness the birth of his fourth child with Shaunie â€” a girl named <strong>Me'arah Sanaa</strong>.</p><img id=postimg title=Shaquille src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famousstardom.com/uploads/2023/05/17/shaquille-o-neal-is-a-legendary-nba-player-who-was-married-to-shaunie-nelson--1684300091.jpg alt=Shaquille width=480 height=480 ezimgfmt="ng ngcb1 src" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-native_bottom"></span><p><span class=imageCaption>Shaquille O'Neal is a legendary NBA player who was married to Shaunie Nelson.<br></span><span class=imageSource>SOURCE: Pinterest</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In 2007, Shaq filed for divorce from his wife Shaunie in Miami. In response to Shaq's divorce petition, Shaunie filed a court motion to dismiss the filing and requested a three-month continuance in hopes of repairing their marriage. Nearly a year after Shaq filed for divorce, Shaunie told the Associated Press that she and her husband planned to stop divorce proceedings.</p><p>Despite their split, the couple has remained on good terms and co-parented their six children. Shaq and Shaunie have maintained a friendly relationship, to co-parent their children in the best way.

After that, he started listening to Phillip's financial advice. Every time an athlete did something crazy with their money, Phillip would remind Shaq that his money wouldn't last forever and that he had to save it and invest it.</p><p>One of the smartest investments Shaq ever made was in Google back in 1999, years before the company became what it is today. He also invested in real estate, tech startups, and other businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at&nbsp;<a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal opening New Restaurant across Staples Center; Attended by Adam Sandler, Diplo and Tiffany Haddish</a></p><h2>The Unforgettable Journey of Phillip Harrison's Son Shaquille O'Neal's Basketball Career</h2><p>Phillip's son, Shaquille O'Neal is one of the most iconic athletes of all time. Born in 1972 and raised in a military family, O'Neal was a dominant force in high school, leading his team to a 68-1 record and a state title. He then went on to play for LSU, where he was twice named an All-American and the SEC Player of the Year.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In 1992, O'Neal was the first pick in the NBA Draft, going to the Orlando Magic. He was an immediate star, winning Rookie of the Year and being voted an All-Star starter. He led the Magic to the playoffs in his second season, and then to the NBA Finals in his third. That same year, he also won a gold medal with the US Olympic team.</p><p>In 1996, O'Neal left the Magic for the Los Angeles Lakers, signing a seven-year, $121 million contract. He was a force for the Lakers in his first few seasons, but the team didn't make the NBA Finals until they hired Phil Jackson as head coach. With Jackson, the Lakers won three titles in a row, with O'Neal winning Finals MVP each time.</p><p>After the 2003-04 season, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat, where he was paired with Dwyane Wade. The Heat won the title in 2006, with O'Neal winning Finals MVP. He then went on to play for the Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics but never won another title. In 2011, he announced his retirement on Twitter and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FSrZirnJ%2Bie6S7zGinoaGcobaxeceaqauho6S7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./usher-responds-to-a-ja-wilson-request-to-join-her-at-las-vegas-aces-parade-8382591.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Usher Responds to A'ja Wilson's Request to Join Las Vegas Aces Parade</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-kay-gig-ambulance-hospital.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Kay forced to stop gig as audience member is rushed to hospital in an ambulance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
