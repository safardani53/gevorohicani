first slashing the victim in the chest, shattering ribs and causing a collapsed lung.</p><p>Describing the second blow, Tim Storrie, prosecuting, said: "He followed up with a 360 degree spin of his arm, an act which was doubtless employed to enhance the speed and devastation of the attack.</p><p>"The blow itself was aimed at the victim’s head.</p><p>"He was dimly aware at this stage of the weeping of blood down into his waistband.</p><p>"He was turning his body, attempting to leave the scene.</p><p>"Through good fortune, he said he realised the axe was above him aiming for his head.</p><p>"He put his arm up to defend himself and the blade essentially severed his arm at the wrist."</p><p>The assault almost completely severed his arm above the wrist and he nearly died because of the amount of blood he lost.</p><p>After witnessing the attack on his colleague and fearing for their safety, one of the workmen started the motor of a <a href=#>chainsaw</a> in a bid to scare the attackers off.</p><p>As a result, the gang members fled the scene.</p><p>Following the brutal attack, the victim staggered away from the scene before collapsing.</p><p>He was later taken to <a href=#>hospital</a> for treatment.</p><h2>Who are the other Adam OCG gang members?</h2><p>Mohammed Sajid, also known as ''Skinny'' was the gang member responsible for delivering the brutal blows.</p><p>In October 2019, he was found guilty of section 18 wounding following a four-week trial at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.</p><p>He was sentenced to 18 years behind bars.</p><p>Judge John Potter told him: "This was a savage and barbaric act against a person who the evidence at trial suggests was acting as a peacemaker."</p><p>Rahman, who was described as the instigator of the attack, was sentenced to four and a half years in <a href=#>prison</a> for conspiracy to commit violent disorder after the court heard he used a knuckleduster to punch one of the other tree surgeons in the face, and as a result broke his nose.</p><p>The OGC member claimed he was subjected to racist threats from the four tree surgeons.</p><p>However, sentencing, Judge Potter said this was a ''pack of lies''.</p><p>He added: "The fact that a mob could be mobilised so quickly and so heavily-armed is clear evidence in my judgement that you are each associated with gang activity."</p><p>Other members of the Adam OCG gang included Mohammed Zillur, Rahman's brother, and Arslan Ali.</p><p>Both were jailed for four years and three years.</p><p>They were also convicted of conspiracy to commit violent disorder.</p><h2>How can I watch The Detectives: Taking Down an OCG?</h2><p>A BBC series titled The Detectives: Taking Down an OCG documents the axe attack and the <a href=#>police</a> operation that followed.</p><p>Episode one of the series airs on <a href=#>BBC Two</a> tonight (Monday, October 30, 2023) at 9pm.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The following two instalments with then air on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><p>However, all episodes are available to watch on the channels <a href=#>streaming</a> service -
