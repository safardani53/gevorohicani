This robotic cleaner earned a perfect five-star rating. We tested it for months to really ensure its star quality, and it’s only gotten better with time. With its stellar vacuum suction, effortless portability, and easy-to-clean filters, it’s not hard to see why we fell in love with this robotic pool cleaner. One of the standout features of the Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus is excellent tracking, which made a huge difference in the cleanliness of our pools. Its advanced navigation technology allows the machine to map out the dimensions and angles of your pool’s floor and walls to pick up any and all debris scattered across the bottom. Like a great <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>robot vacuum</a>, it only gets better with more frequent use. After months of testing, we noticed that it seemed to navigate areas of the pool even better than when it was first used, due to a better understanding of the pool’s surface area, making it as intuitive as it is effective. Did we mention that it also has an excellent wall grip? No matter where your debris may be located, the Dolphin is sure to snatch it up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a cleaning device that works this effectively, it makes sense that its price tag is a bit high. At $900, this Dolphin is surely an investment. But we think that the performance quality and longevity of this pool cleaner far outweigh the mediocrity of other, less-expensive options that may not last longer than a summer. We can confidently say that if you invest in this pool cleaner, you won’t be disappointed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">$799 (orig. $999) at Amazon</a></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 10 x 10 x 10 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 19 lbs. | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Up to 50 ft | <strong>Filter:</strong> Twin cartridges | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> 2 hours | <strong>Smart features:</strong> No</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2645 data-sizes=750px alt="Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus Robotic Pool Cleaner bagged parts displayed on wooden deck" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1soZcALBdDvUPf5Um6WpTCoue9c=/fit-in/1500x2645/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pool-cleaners-dolphin-cc-plus-robotic-vacuum-amazon-matt-strelecki-01.jpg-0a0c75838c014ec1a1db77aad95e77d6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Matt Strelecki</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2584 data-sizes=750px alt="Person showing bottom of Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus Robotic Pool Cleaner on wooden deck" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/adVeSs5QIZ-nSYhshMoMpbR9rAc=/fit-in/1500x2584/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pool-cleaners-dolphin-cc-plus-robotic-vacuum-amazon-matt-strelecki-02.jpg-96722e35304b4dc699bba07fb3de5664.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Matt Strelecki</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brush-lalapool-professional-pool-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Brush</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lalapool Professional Pool Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lalapool Swimming Pool Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/yaZAX9cq40NTDbqsFuAL6utOoeA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lalapool-swimming-pool-brush-b7e4b0c224994c049cf49212b5de6187.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Its snap-on cleaning head connects easily to your everyday skimmer pole</p></li><li readability=1><p>We were able to deeply clean our pool walls and floors without fear of ripping our liners thanks to its durable, yet non-abrasive bristles</p></li><li readability=-1><p>You can’t beat its ultra-low price point</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes you have to get picky with your pool cleaning, and one of the best ways to ensure your liner gets the five-star treatment is with a tried-and-true brush clean. This 18-inch wall and tile brush is the perfect addition to your maintenance regimen due to its premium nylon bristles, easy snap-on design, and sturdy, rust-proof aluminum material that’s sure to last several seasons and keep your pool sparkling clean for more fun in the sun. We loved how easy it was to snap onto our pre-owned poles, whether from a skimmer or another tool, and the brush was effective on our liners without being abrasive. Its curved edges make it easy to scrub hard-to-reach corners, and the nail-free design removes any concerns of liner rips or tile damage. The best part? It’s only $21.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You do have to go out and buy a pole (or search for one on your property) if you don’t already have one, as this brush does not come with one. However, we find this to be incredibly helpful (and space-saving) if you already own a detachable skimmer or other extension pole-requiring pool tool because you can have a 2-in-1 product without storing more large tools in your garage or shed. Overall, we felt that an up-close and personal scrub with this brush gave us a stellar clean that we might trust even more than a robot pool cleaner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $13.59 (orig. $18.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 17 x 5.3 x 1.7 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 0.65 lbs. | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Not applicable | <strong>Filter:</strong> None | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> Not applicable | <strong>Cleaning frequency:</strong> Not applicable | <strong>Smart features:</strong> None</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Kim Vogt</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-poolwhale-pool--spa-vacuum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Poolwhale Pool & Spa Vacuum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pool Vacuum Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8_4vE2S0ix_Xz_ghzeiBl4fZhHc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/poolwhale-portable-pool-vacuum-cleaner-66a67233bc2c4890b0e79efde0925e1c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>This considerably less-expensive pick had surprisingly strong suction; it picked up pieces of debris that weren’t even visible to the naked eye</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its filter can hold an impressive amount of debris</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s incredibly easy to assemble — simply snap the pole onto the cleaner head</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>You do have to get wet with this one — its stick attachment requires in-water cleaning, almost like vacuuming a room</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s a bit hard to empty the snap-shut debris bag</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re of the mindset that the best cleaning jobs are accomplished by hand, then you’ll fall in love with the PoolWhale Pool Vacuum Jet. This stick vacuum pool cleaner is easy to assemble and can be attached to a pole you already own or the one that comes with it: Simply attach the cleaner to the pole, connect your garden hose, and it’s ready to go. It includes a heavy-duty vacuum bag that sucks up every last stick and piece of debris on your pool’s floor — even small specks of clutter that we hadn’t noticed before cleaning. All this to say, we got a stellar clean for a smaller-sized pool with this affordable vacuum pool cleaner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We do think that it would be a tougher job to clean larger pools with this stick, as it has a smaller reach and you have to be in the water to clean larger and deeper pools — though if you're cleaning a standard spa or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>inflatable hot tub</a>, this isn't an issue. If you’re willing to put in the extra legwork, this budget-friendly option is not only softer on your account balance, but it’s a thorough cleaning tool, as well. Just be sure to take time to clean out the vacuum bag afterward; it’s so effective that it can be hard to clean out, due to all of the gunk it just picked up from your pool’s floor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $24.99 (orig. $28.99)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4.72 x 10.43 x 47.24 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1.25 lbs. | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Up to 25 ft | <strong>Filter:</strong> Not applicable | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> 20 mins | <strong>Smart features:</strong> None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-robotic-aiper-seagull-pro-robotic-pool-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Robotic</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aiper Seagull Pro Robotic Pool Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aiper Seagull Pro Robotic Pool Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/W41ssbQ2RZtkETBSjUh9M6Lw-BU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aiper-seagull-pro-robotic-pool-cleaner-0e0bef1d3ef647d299ca306d15baacf3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>This cleaner came completely assembled, which made the process incredibly smooth from the get-go</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Extremely easy to store due to the lack of cords and hoses</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its cordless design and whisper-quiet workings are the icing on the cake</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=0><p>It’s hard to tell where to attach the retrieval hook when it’s nighttime or in the deep end because it’s not clearly marked</p></li><li readability=0><p>We wish it had an app so we could control its movements or cleaning mode and check the battery level</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Let’s face it, having and maintaining a pool is a hassle in and of itself, so the least your pool vacuum can do is effectively clean it (bonus points if it’s hands-off). That’s why we loved the intuitive, sleek, and incredibly smart Aiper Seagull Pro — a cordless, robotic pool cleaner that ate up our pool’s miscellaneous debris in a quick and effective fashion. The machine came completely assembled, which was our first indicator that this cleaner was going to be one of our best (and easiest to use) models yet. After a quick 90-minute charge and a drop in the water, we tested out its three cleaning modes (auto-mode, floor and wall cleaning combined, floor only, and wall only), and watched as the Seagull learned the layout of our pool more and more with each use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we do wish this cleaner came with a bluetooth app to provide more control functionality, we appreciate its natural intuitiveness (and the space it saves on our phones). We also loved how easy it was to store in our garage due to its cordless design. While we love its sleek look, we would like to see a bit more of an obvious indication of the retrieval arm location, because it’s hard to hook onto our poles at nighttime or while it's in the deep end in order to pull it out of the water. However, this super smart robotic pool cleaner knows to pull over to the side when it's low on battery, so you won’t have a pool cleaner stranded in the middle of the deep end. Overall, we loved this robotic pool cleaner for its stellar cleans and unbeatable convenience. Truly, all we had to do was drop it in and take it out.

It took us mere seconds to set up thanks to its straightforward instructions, setting the scene for what would be an easy, breezy clean. This top-performer runs on a continuous schedule and cleaned the dirty in-ground pool we tested it in in just 3 hours, but we kept it in the water pretty consistently because of the constant debris flying off of our backyard flora and fauna. Despite this environmental challenge, this Polaris model left our pool floors, stairs, and walls sparkling clean with each and every run.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also appreciated its small, lightweight design (only 20 by 23 inches and a little over six pounds). This made it easy to take apart and clean, as the filter bag needs to be emptied and rinsed out after it fills up with the leaves, dirt, and other various particles from your pool. But don’t be fooled by its petite frame — this pressure-side cleaner is small, but mighty. We wish it did a little more in terms of scrubbing our surfaces, but it’s just not that type of cleaner (so if you’re looking for a scrubbing superstar, we’d suggest something else on this list). But for a pressure pool vacuum, this was our favorite.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $599</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 20 x 23 x 10 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 6.20 lbs. | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Filter:</strong> Bag | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> 3 hours | <strong>Cleaning frequency:</strong> Constant | <strong>Smart features:</strong> None</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jennifer Zyman</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-design-dolphin-nautilus-cc-automatic-robotic-pool-vacuum-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Design</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dolphin Nautilus CC Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dolphin Nautilus CC Automatic Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/g-P5kcNstLMyKpy5OXhWMfXNLiA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dolphin-nautilus-cc-automatic-robotic-pool-vacuum-cleaner-fd8be13607a14ad2973e8d5b455b4e90.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=0><p>With its fully-assembled arrival and intuitive navigation, this model was very easy to operate</p></li><li readability=0><p>We love its sleek, stingray-like design</p></li><li readability=1><p>When we ran into issues with the machine about six months into use, the customer service team was wonderful in setting us up with a solution</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pools are hard enough to maintain, so the machine doing the maintenance shouldn’t add to the stress. From unboxing to the first drop into the water, it took less than three minutes to get the pre-assembled Dolphin Nautilus CC Automatic Robotic Pool Cleaner ready to go. We loved the design of this pool cleaner for its sleek, stingray-like look, and its comprehensive functions were impressive, too. After a few cleaning sessions, we were able to easily remove the filter, empty it out, and click it back into place with no problem. You can move the machine in and out of the water effortlessly thanks to its quick water-release function. Its scrubbers are not to be overlooked, either. They worked diligently to brush every surface and collect the pollen, leaves, and other debris that had scattered around the pool.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re a fan of no-frills machinery, then you’ll love how minimalistic this cleaner is. There’s no display of confusing buttons to press and program, because you can simply plug in the pool vacuum, push a button, and drop the cleaner into the water for an enhanced clean. However, after six months of consistent use the vacuum did stop working, but the customer service experience made up for it. Dolphin offered to fix the issue immediately and sent the return label so that the process was completely paid for — making this a happy ending in our book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $649</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 16.38 x 16.77 x 8.97 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 13.8 lbs. | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Up to 33 ft | <strong>Filter:</strong> Fine filter basket | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> 2 hours | <strong>Smart features:</strong> None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wall-climbing-hayward-the-poolcleaner-2-wheel-suction-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Wall-Climbing</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hayward The PoolCleaner Suction Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hayward Poolvergnuegen The PoolCleaner 2-Wheel Suction Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/OPel1NR5gC17jRiLv3XDMzG3zyQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hayward-poolvergnuegen-pool-cleaner-899caf3500284cc096b4c0bf6cf078e0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>The machine’s uniquely strong tire treads give the wheels extra grip in order to effectively climb and clean the walls</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its self-pivoting wheels make sure that you never have to reach in and redirect a confused machine</p></li><li readability=1><p>Its smart steering works well in both small and large pools, as well as curved and rectangular shaped pools</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have trees, plants, or mulch around your pool, then you know how hard it is to keep the bottom of your pool — and your pool walls — pristine. The Hayward Poolvergnuegen Pool Cleaner is the one for the job, as this machine will suck up even the smallest of debris that you can’t quite spot in the rippling water. Despite its medium size, we liked how lightweight it was, and the machine itself is white, so it always stands out clearly in the water (a.k.a. you can tell if it’s getting stuck, which it hasn’t). But to us, its standout feature was its super strong treads, as the cleaner’s high-grip tires made this model stand out from the rest when it came to wall-climbing abilities and navigation. Though the pool we tested it in was a little larger than recommended (it’s best for in-ground pools up to 16 by 32 feet), we still think it did a phenomenal job vacuuming up debris like dirt, sand, and leaves.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another perk of this machine is the self-adjusting turbine, which can sift through large debris and alternate between three adjustable suction levels, even if it encounters clogs or larger messes. We did, however, notice that this cleaning process took a lot longer than others we’d experienced in the past with different pool cleaners, but we didn’t mind the extra time, thanks to the glittering results. We can assume it would have been more time-efficient in a smaller pool, but we still were left with a pristine liner in our 20 by 40 foot testing pool. Because of its wall-climbing abilities and deep water compatibility, we’d recommend this for people with in-ground pools over above-ground.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $429</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 40.4 x 13.6 x 11.9 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 4.9 lbs. | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Up to 32 ft | <strong>Filter:</strong> None | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> 7 hours | <strong>Cleaning frequency:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Smart features:</strong> None</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-suction-pentair-360042-kreepy-krauly-pleated-seal-pool-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Suction</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pentair Kreepy Krauly Pool Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pentair 360042 Kreepy Krauly Pleated Seal Pool Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/kb5nSUqad22-lPxNE-oM12dS7Xk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pentair-360042-kreepy-krauly-suction-side-inground-universal-pool-cleaner-pleated-seal-9c074f2a5f65471492f0b60fd257cc2b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This model left the floors of our pools looking better than they ever had before</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s so lightweight that we could lift it out of the pool with one hand</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The cleaner effectively removed salt and chlorine stains</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a pool vac with some major cleaning power, then this is the one for you. The Pentair Kreepy Krauly left our pools looking more crystal-clear than ever before, and it’s all thanks to the superior suction that its pleated seal provides. We were blown away by how easily it mowed through high-debris areas, sucking up large leaves and even salt and chlorine stains with ease (yes, its suction is that strong). It was easy to extract this cleaner out of the pool with just one hand after every use because of its light, 15-pound weight, which makes it easy for anyone in the family to take care of. Plus, it’s pretty low maintenance, as it’s practically one big piece (almost looking like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>household vacuum</a>) instead of a more compact machine with complicated parts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because it’s a little less fanciful than some of the other winners, it takes a bit more time to set up this one than some of the more expensive options on this list. While others are more drop-and-go, this one took us about 15 minutes to set up each time we went to use it. But then again, there are trade-offs when it comes to price versus convenience. We also want to note that since this one connected to the pump, we noticed a bit of wear and tear after routinely using this model. However, this can happen with suction pool cleaners, and we didn’t want to dock points for its more elaborate setup due to its considerably lower price when compared to our other contesters. For suction like no other, the Kreppy Krauly can do the heavy lifting (or should we say, crawling) for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $329.99 (orig. $378.17)</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 42 x 16.5 x 7.5 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 15 lbs. | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Filter:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> 1 hour | <strong>Cleaning frequency:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Smart features:</strong> None</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-11 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Pentair 360042 Kreepy Krauly Pool Cleaner displayed beside pool next to a waterfall feature " data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/CHhnuH3yciuY83IQpB1g1rv5nNw=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-suction-pool-cleaners-test-pentair-360042-kreepy-krauly-rob-roszkowski-02-0cdbbe4edcf34e708fad1a247987bdbd.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Rob Roszkowski</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2302 data-sizes=750px alt="Pentair 360042 Kreepy Krauly Pool Cleaner cleaning the hot tub section of a pool " data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KKnhsVcOW-bin-pS64VFwvvA4yY=/fit-in/1500x2302/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-suction-pool-cleaners-test-pentair-360042-kreepy-krauly-rob-roszkowski-01-6b4c11c8576744dda76b25bcaff9f6e9.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Rob Roszkowski</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-corded-polaris-7000-above-ground-robotic-pool-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Corded</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Polaris Above Ground Robotic Pool Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Polaris 7000 Robotic Pool Cleaner " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ONDNRQ5PtmIC9B1HiNuZcm-A8Xo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/polaris-7000-robotic-pool-cleaner-e1bdca4912d64454ac3bcfa0d6eb1a53.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Leslie's</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>This machine was super easy to set up: Simply attach the hose to the control panel and power it on</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its super-strong suction was able to effectively rid our pool of visible algae</p></li><li readability=0><p>The hose is tangle-proof, slipping and sliding past loops in the water to avoid knots</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=1><p>This machine is definitely on the expensive side of things, but still isn’t nearly as high as some of the other picks on this list</p></li><li readability=0><p>There’s no blinking light or app notification to let you know that the cleaning cycle has been completed</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’re going to want a pool cleaner that can weather the storm (literally), and that’s exactly what we found in the Polaris 7000 Robotic Pool Cleaner. This machine is best for above-ground pools and includes a 40-foot cord that can service a pool up to 30 feet in size, which is a total win in our book (and backyards). We found this pool cleaner to be incredibly easy to operate since it came nearly ready to be dropped in the water — we just attached the hose and let it go. It’s also super easy to remove the filter with a press of the release button, which we had to do once the cleaner ran through the pool’s post-storm algae-ridden water (which it sucked up so effectively that it was visible to the eye in rippling water).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We noticed that as it came to the higher points of the wall, we could see the water’s surface start to quiver under the powerful suction of this vacuum. And we can’t forget about the tangle-proof cord, a lifesaver in any pool. After many claims of tangle-resistant hoses, we can truly say that this one stayed in its lane and avoided knots at all times — a must-have for above-ground pool owners. While we wished it was a little less expensive and had a better indicator for when the cleaning cycle was complete (it just stops moving and flashes a small red light), we think this is an impressive corded model.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $749.99</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Weight:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Filter:</strong> Canister | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> 1 hour | <strong>Cleaning frequency:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Smart features:</strong> None</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Steven Schrimpf</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cordless-aiper-seagull-1000-cordless-robotic-pool-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cordless</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aiper Seagull 1000 Robotic Pool Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aiper Seagull 1000 Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/yMlQYTr8vqhe7Nh4Z-tPRMtSoXg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aiper-seagull-1000-cordless-robotic-pool-cleaner-46fabd7b8a954c5cb24e7679c930ae1e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li><p>Easy setup and storage</p></li><li readability=0><p>Compared to other $900 and higher options, the price of this machine is fairly reasonable</p></li><li readability=1><p>Its wide, dual-paneled suction doors collect everything from larger debris to barely-visible insects and dirt granules</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Aiper Seagull 1000 is sharply designed, compact, and cordless, which is amazing for easy usage and storage.

We do advise people with flat pools to use this particular model over those with deep and shallow ends, as the device tends to get stuck in the deep end and not attempt to ascend up the slope if it’s running low on battery.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But for the price, great suction power, and intuitive cleaning process, we think this model is an excellent pick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price at time of publish: $389.99</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 15.16 x 14.37 x 7.68 inches | <strong>Weight:</strong> 15.27 lbs. | <strong>Pool size:</strong> Up to 35 ft above ground, up to 50 ft in-ground | <strong>Filter:</strong> Easy-clean cartridge | <strong>Cleaning time:</strong> 90 minutes | <strong>Cleaning frequency:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Smart features:</strong> Robotic cleaning</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-app-controlled-dolphin-nautilus-cc-supreme-robotic-pool-vacuum-cleaner-with-wi-fi-control></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best App-Controlled</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dolphin Nautilus CC Supreme Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dolphin Nautilus CC Supreme Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner with Wi-Fi Control" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QJKHzDi9Ax85RgFJvf5eDoUy4Bk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dolphin-nautilus-cc-supreme-robotic-pool-vacuum-cleaner-with-wi-fi-control-f14e658033094ca0a16c3ba84dc42442.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>It’s super easy to extract this machine from the water thanks to its thick top handle</p></li><li readability=0><p>The cleaner comes with a helpful app with effective WiFi communication that handles everything from cleaning frequency to cleaning style</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its three powerful scrub brushes work diligently on both the floors and walls</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>Clocking in at $1,500, this model is definitely one of our more expensive machines on our list</p></li><li readability=1><p>We saw a bit of a struggle on the stairs, so we had to give the cleaner a boost to get an effective cleaning</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dolphin continues to be a winner for us throughout this testing process.

Some pool cleaners are best suited for smaller pools, which are typically up to 30 feet in length, while other pool cleaners are made for larger pools that can range up to 60 feet. Whether or not your pool is in-ground or above ground will also determine which cleaners are best for you. (You don’t want a wall-climbing cleaning robot in an above-ground pool.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A manual cleaning tool, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Swimming Pool Wall & Tile Brush</a>, is typically intended for an above-ground pool, as in-ground pools are usually too physically taxing to clean yourself.

Most cleaners need to be attached to your pool’s filter in order to work properly — the only exception being a robotic pool cleaner, which you can plug into an electrical plug (or charge) and set into the water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are three types of filters that home pools can include: sand, diatomaceous earth, and cartridge. Sand filters are among the oldest (and most affordable) models, sifting water through grains of sand to trap large debris from the water. Diatomaceous earth, or DE, absorbs water impurities at a molecular level, keeping your pool extremely clean of dirt and other contaminants (but still not exempt from the need of a pool cleaner). Cartridge filters are another common modern-day filter, acting as the middleman price- and performance-wise for sand and DE, and these filters are fairly common for in-ground pools.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Function</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the age of technology, it’s no surprise that our pool cleaners can do almost as much as our computers.

Each model was then rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the poorest-performing rating and 5 being the best, based on design, ease of use, effectiveness, and value.
