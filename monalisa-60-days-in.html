This is a national support and advocacy group for parents who have incarcerated children. She is living in New York City with her husband Lorenzo.</p><p>Speaking in an interview about why she created the organisation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Monalisa said</span></a>:</p><p>I started that out of my pain because I had nowhere to turn. Society is so judgmental, especially our Black society. We hate on each other so badly, it is just kind of sad. When we know that the majority of our families are the ones that are being disproportionately affected. Yet, we judge each other so bad to say that, “You know what, there has got to be something wrong with the parents if the kid goes to jail. It has got to be some sort of way that they were raised. It is just got to be their fault.” You know what? In some cases they are right. In some cases they are not, you know. I created this so that they could have an outlet and find the resources that they needed to get through this.</p><ul><li><span style=text-decoration:underline><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">READ MORE</a>:</strong></span> Where is Robert Holcomb from 60 Days In now?</li></ul><h3>Monalisa on 60 Days In</h3><p>Monalisa was inspired to take on the 60 Days In program after her daughter fell into a life of crime. When we met Monalisa on the show, her daughter was serving a ten-year mandatory sentence.</p><p>While taking part in the program, Monalisa was greatly affected by the realities of jail. It was particularly hard for Monalisa, as the way she was living at Clark County Jail was the way her daughter lived her day-to-day life.</p><p>In the final episode of the series, Monalisa said “going to jail changed my relationship with Sierra in every single aspect.”</p><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>UPDATE</span></a>:</strong> Where is Zac “Holland” Baker from 60 Days In now?</li></ul><h3>What happened to Monalisa’s daughter?</h3><p>In 2012, Sierra Johnson was a straight A student and even graduated from high school early, securing a place at an Atlanta college. While at college, Sierra became involved with drugs and began taking “Molly,” or MDMA, a recreational party drug. When Monalisa had not heard from her daughter for two weeks, uncovered that she was skipping class, she received a phone call from Sierra explaining that she was in jail. Sierra had been arrested for armed robbery.</p><p>What came to light was that Sierra and a school friend had been manipulated by an&nbsp;older man with a violent criminal past into committing this armed robbery. In the state of Georgia, this offence results in mandatory jail time.</p><p>Monalisa Johnson’s daughter Sierra has since been released from jail.</p><p>On December 20th, 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>Monalisa posted on Facebook</span></a> that Sierra had been released one day earlier. Monalisa wrote:</p>It is finished. My daughter is finally free. As of 12/19 @ 8pm. After mounds of paperwork, major snafoos, mixups and lots of gratitude allow me to introduce you to my one and only flesh of my flesh and blood… SIERRA!Nothing but the miracle working power of God, massive hope, goo gobbs of patience and hard work and determination got her released 5 years Early!<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-85685 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-17-at-15.53.27-1024x568.png alt width=750 height=416 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px">Screenshot: 60 Days In S2 E1 – Netflix<p style=text-align:center>WATCH 60 DAYS IN SEASON 2 ON NETFLIX NOW&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/svg/1f4f8.svg alt=? style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>&nbsp;<strong>AND&nbsp;</strong><strong>GET FREAKY WITH US ON</strong>&nbsp;<span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>INSTAGRAM</span></a>&nbsp;</span><strong>AND</strong>&nbsp;<span style=text-decoration:underline><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FACEBOOK</a></span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnnaS7orjIrJhmbmBisaLF0magpw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erin-moran-cause-of-death-secret-illness-revealed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erin Moran Cause of Death: Secret Illness Revealed?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-garner-gray-swimsuit-beach-kids-pics-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Garner Rocks Gray Swimsuit While Hitting Beach With Kids Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
