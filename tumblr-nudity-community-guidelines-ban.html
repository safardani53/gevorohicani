Community labels gives a post creator more control over who can see their post (only those who want to see it, or only those over eighteen, for example).</p><p>"On the post consumption side, community labels allow anyone on Tumblr to omit categories of posts from their dashboard completely if they so choose. They can also blur the posts, or choose to have them show up like normal."</p><p>They added: "We want to encourage creativity, self-expression, and exploration, but we also want to make sure that folks can avoid content they'd rather not see."</p><h2>When did Tumblr ban adult content?</h2><p>Tumblr was noted for its sizeable amount of pornographic content, with a reported 16.45 percent of blogs exclusively containing pornographic material.</p><p>On December 17, 2018, Tumblr banned adult content - including pictures, GIFs, illustrations, and videos that "depicts sex acts."</p><p>After this, all content that Tumblr's sensors flagged as violating their policies&nbsp;was set to private and could then only be seen by the blog's creator.</p><p>The news generated shock and anger among users as, up until then, porn had been allowed on Tumblr since its founding in 2007.</p><p>It impacted a large proportion of its user community who used the platform to share erotic and NSFW imagery including everything from fanart to sex education.</p><p>The ban particularly affected those representing&nbsp;LGBT&nbsp;communities who felt underrepresented by&nbsp;mainstream sites and used it as a safe haven to share creative work with adult themes.</p><p>Within a year of the "porn ban," traffic to Tumblr and app downloads dropped drastically.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TechCrunch</a>, the platform's "web traffic has dropped by around 30% and has largely stagnated."</p><p>In 2019, Tumblr&nbsp;was bought by the WordPress owner, Automattic, for less than $3million, compared with its&nbsp;once-$1.1 billion price tag, as per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/NINTCHDBPICT000450781257.jpg><h2>What caused Tumblr to ban adult content?</h2><p>It seemed very likely that Apple forced Tumblr to make the move.</p><p>In November 2018, Apple removed the blogging platform from its app store over child pornography issues.</p><p>Apple’s iOS guidelines state that all apps must have a content filter to screen out such material.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, Tumblr said that while every image uploaded to the platform is “scanned against an industry database of child sexual abuse material” to filter out explicit images, a “routine audit” discovered content that was absent from the database, allowing it to slip through the filter.</p><p>This led to a sitewide crackdown on pornography and eventually the banning of adult content.</p><h2>What is Tumblr?</h2><p>Tumblr&nbsp;is a blogging and social media tool founded by David Karpthat in 2007.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The platform follows a free-form nature and allows users to publish a "tumblelog" - or short blog posts - while being given the creative ability to heavily customize their own pages.</p><p>Tumblr is one of few social media networks to have design flexibility, unlike Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, which all have standard profile pages that cannot be altered by users.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2cnKBfZoJ6fZdubmlnpKq6o7jRZqWunJmpxm6vzqakrqaZqcZus9Sim56kmaOytHnBmqVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-adam-pate-dating.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Adam Pate Dating Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./idris-elba-see-pics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pics Of The Actors Life Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write?
