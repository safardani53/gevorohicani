Kate is a writer, arts advocate, and Board Chair of Ballet Hispánico, according to a 2022 listing on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PBS</a>. She’s also married to <strong>Jonathan LaPook</strong>, a medical doctor often featured on CBS, and together, they have two children.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“To me, Norman Lear’s longevity has just as much to do with his in-born optimism,” Kate wrote about her father on his 100th birthday. “This is a man who goes to bed each night dreaming of the cup of coffee he will have in the morning, who has lived a life in which each meal magically turns out to be better than the one before (‘this is the best pasta I’ve ever had'”), and who has said, many times, that he doesn’t want to wake up the day that he doesn’t have hope.”</p><h2>Maggie Lear</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/maggie-lear-norman-lear-kids-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>Maggie Lear</strong>, the youngest child of Norman Lear and Frances Loeb, obtained her master’s degree in social work from New York University.

She is a Chair of the Youth Justice Funding Collaborative, a 21-year-old network of funders and activists who support organizations in New Orleans focused on decarceration. Maggie is a member of The Justice Fund at the New York Women’s Foundation as well as the FreeHer Fund at the Circle for Justice Innovations.”</p><h2>Benjamin Lear</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Benjamin Lear</strong> – the eldest child of Norman and his third wife, Lyn Davis – was born in 1988. He’s the only child of Norman Lear to follow in his father’s footsteps. After studying music at New York University, he directed his first film, 2016’s The Call us Monsters. The documentary detailed “legislators debate legislation that allows for adult charges for juvenile offenders,” and the effect of the penile system has on young offenders. In 2017, Ben directed Bad For The Boats, a “metaphysical thriller masquerading as a farcical comedy about the devastating consequences of being a narcissistic asshole.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“I knew he was a pretty big-time guy from very early on, but it had already been a whole generation since those shows were filling the airwaves,” Benjamin said of his father in 2016, per the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Los Angeles Times</a>. “I knew the characters. I had seen scenes of them. I could feel his humor and perspective in them. But I hadn’t really dug in.”</p><h2>Brianna & Madelaine Lear</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/brianna-lear-norman-lear-kids-shutterstock-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-16>Norman and Lyn welcomed twins <strong>Madelaine Rose</strong> and <strong>Brianna Elizabeth Lear</strong> in 1994. Norman was 72 at the time, and his wife was 47.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>In the years since, Brianna attended the University of Southern California. “Growing up, we always saw plays and musical theater. Part of our time together which is, you know, maybe healthy and unhealthy [laughs], is we watch a lot of movies together. I definitely grew up as a child of the industry. My father and my Mom both really wanted me to pursue a career in acting and singing most of my life. That’s what I thought I wanted to pursue,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she said in a 2018</a> interview. “And then I ultimately shifted gears, but it’s still something that’s really important to me. I am constantly reminded of the power of music and art in my own self-care. It’s something I definitely miss. And I want to find ways of incorporating it more.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Brianna was one of the teams of graduate students at the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>USC’s Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work</a>. Though she didn’t enter the entertainment industry, Brianna shared her family’s commitment to social justice.
