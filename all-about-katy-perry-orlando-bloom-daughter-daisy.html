"We have yet to decide specifically on her name because, I think, we've got options and she'll tell us," Perry explained in a June 2020 interview with Mix 104.1's Karson & Kennedy.

"The first thing I do when I wake up is a little tiny verbal ritual. I do it every single morning. I say to myself out loud, 'Thank you, God, for today.
