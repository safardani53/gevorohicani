To be the nice, girl next door who was nothing extraordinary or special.</p><p>“They were so annoyed and disappointed about having a daughter who was opposite to what they dreamed. It was very hard.&nbsp;</p><p>“My parents hated it and my brother doesn’t speak to me anymore but I don’t care, it’s my way of life and my body.&nbsp;</p><p>“They absolutely hated my look because they disliked anything sexy, feminine or female - but I feel so much happier than I ever was before."</p><p>Kitty continue to dress in goth-style clothing in her adult life and held down ‘normal’ sales and office jobs but secretly longed for more.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2008, she had the first of two boob jobs and now she has a 1050cc implant in each breast, which transformed her natural C cup boobs to a H cup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1050cc-implant-boob-560cc-per-826862967.jpg><p>That same year, Kitty also started using lip filler to alter her “very small lips” and facial filler to give herself a more angular face.</p><p>Kitty admits plastic surgeons have turned her down “very, very often" because they think the implants she wants are "too big".</p><p>She adds: “I have always been impressed by women with very feminine, big, plastic breasts on the internet and knew that’s what I wanted to look like.</p><p>“I have become obsessed with getting bigger boobs, bigger lips and a bigger bum, I consider myself as a piece of art.</p><p>“Bimbo-fication has helped me to do that. I love my superficial and exaggerated look. I want to be stared at by people.”</p><h2>'Women are jealous'</h2><p>Drawing public attention is important to Kitty – who has an <a href=#>OnlyFans</a> page and works as a club promoter – but it also comes with its drawbacks.</p><p>Many aren’t impressed by her exaggerated appearance especially when she wears “more sexy, latex outfits and high heels” - but she remains unfazed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kitty says: “Some people don’t appreciate my look and shake their heads. It’s mostly women, I think they are jealous because they even tell their partners not to look at me.</p><p>“They say I’m ‘disgusting’ and ‘unnatural’ or go, ‘Oh my god, it’s too much’. But I think it’s because they are worried their partners will want them to look like me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1050cc-implant-boob-560cc-per-827791628.jpg><p>“Most people are nice and some ask me questions like, ‘Can you really kiss with those lips?’ and I’m like, ‘Sure, it’s much better kissing big lips, believe me’.</p><p>“They also ask if my boobs get in the way and disturb my work, which they do, but you just work around them. Sometimes my bum hurts if I’m been lying down too much too.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kitty has been married for 30 years and says her husband, who shuns the spotlight, loves her look.&nbsp;</p><p>She claims he even enjoys it when other blokes ogle at his wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Kitty says: “He loves the attention I and he gets. He’s very proud because other men are jealous and wish they had a trophy wife like me.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“My husband is absolutely into my <a href=#>body modifications</a>. He loves each step and every time I go bigger.
