Born in Holloway, North London, Howe developed an interest in the guitar and began to learn the instrument himself at age 12. He embarked on a music career in 1964, first playing in several London-based blues, covers, and psychedelic rock bands for six years, including the Syndicats, Tomorrow, and Bodast. Upon joining Yes in 1970, Howe helped to change the band's musical direction, leading to more commercial and critical success. Many of their best-known songs were co-written by Howe, who remained with the band until they briefly disbanded in 1981. Howe returned to the group in 1990 for two years and has remained a full-time member since 1995. Howe achieved further success in the 1980s and beyond as a member of the rock bands Asia, GTR, and Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe.</p><table class=wikibox readability=18><tr><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>Stephen James Howe</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>April 8, 1947, Holloway, London, England</td></tr><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Genres</td><td class=wk_value>Progressive rock, art rock, instrumental rock, hard rock, psychedelic rock, jazz fusion</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Occupation(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Musician, songwriter, producer</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Instruments</td><td class=wk_value>Guitar</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1964–present</td></tr><tr readability=8><td class=wk_label>Labels</td><td class=wk_value>Atlantic, Relativity, Eagle, InsideOut, Voiceprint, Caroline, HoweSound</td></tr><tr readability=11><td class=wk_label>Associated acts</td><td class=wk_value>Bodast, Tomorrow (formerly The In Crowd), the Syndicats, Explorer's Club, Yes, Asia, Lou Reed, GTR, Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe</td></tr></table><p>Guitarist Steve Howe was born on April 8, 1947 in England (He's 76 years old now).</p><p>Yes's guitarist and backup singer, David Gilmour, is an English musician best known for his work with the prog rock band Yes.
