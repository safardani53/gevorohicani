He also opened up about his dating life, and one of his responses left some fans a bit confused.</p><p>“Since my divorce, I’ve had a few dates and nothing’s panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public. Dating’s just not where I’m at lately,” said the 45-year-old rapper, who was previously married to <strong>Kim Mathers</strong> from 1999 to 2001 and again briefly in 2006. When asked if he uses any dating apps, Em responded, “Yeah, Tinder. And Grindr. I also used to go to strip clubs.”</p><p>Eminem’s revelation that he uses Tinder may not come as a huge surprise to fans. However, Grindr is geared toward gay and bisexual men, which raised a few eyebrows because Eminem identifies as straight.</p><p>“Eminem casually mentions in an interview he uses Grindr and the reporter DOESN’T follow up?? Worst journalism of the year,” one Twitter user quipped. Another wrote, “Wait….what?! EMINEM IS ON TINDER?!? (And Grindr?!?) Not enough exclamation marks for this.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Eminem casually mentions in an interview he uses Grindr and the reporter DOESN'T follow up??

(@BiancaEnRogue) <a href=#>December 19, 2017</a></p><p>Slim Shady faced backlash earlier in his career for his homophobic lyrics, but he explained to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> in 2013 that he used the language in a “tongue-in-cheek” way. “Those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin’ or whatever, I never really equated those words [with homosexuality],” he said. “It was more like calling someone a bitch or a punk or a–hole. … But the real me sitting here right now talking to you has no issues with gay, straight, transgender, at all.”</p><p>See more reactions to Eminem’s Grindr remark below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>There's been a lot of great journalism in 2017, but the reported who didn't ask Eminem any followup questions about using Grindr has let down their entire profession <a href=#>https://t.co/sVTD6qr1lw</a></p><p>— Elijah Clark-Ginsberg (@eclarkginsberg) <a href=#>December 19, 2017</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Eminem?!
