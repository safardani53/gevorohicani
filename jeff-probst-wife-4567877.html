According to the outlet, Jeff and Lisa married in an “intimate ceremony” at a “private Los Angeles residence” surrounded only by family and friends for the occasion.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In a few old clips from the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Larry King Now show</a>, Jeff revealed to the host, the late <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Larry King</strong></a>, about how he met Lisa at&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;producer&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mark Burnett</strong></a>‘s annual Christmas party.</p><h2><strong><strong>She used to be married to Mark-Paul Gosselaar</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jeff-Probst-Wife.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lisa and Jeff’s marriage was the second for both of them, as Jeff was first married to psychotherapist <strong>Shelly Wright</strong> from 1996 to 2001 and Lisa was wed to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Mark-Paul Gosselaar</strong></a> from 1996 to 2010.

While talking with Larry King for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his Hulu show in 2012</a>, Jeff shared how he and Lisa split custody with Mark-Paul and how the children truly became like his own. “[Lisa and Mark-Paul] were together almost 20 years. They had a long marriage and they raised these two young kids,” Jeff explained. “They raised them with the kind of love that the kids they see me — and [Mark-Paul’s] now remarried, his wife [<strong>Catriona McGinn</strong>] … they just see us as two more parents.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The TV show host went on to proclaim that he didn’t see Michael and Ava as “step kids,” but as his own children. He also told&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rachel Ray</a>&nbsp;</strong>while appearing on her talk show that they were a “blended family” and definitely got along as a loving family unit. “I think of them as mine, which is crazy, but then they have this other family … but I always have to remember they have a dad,” Jeff told the talk show host, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Men’s Health</a>.</p><h2><strong><strong>She wanted him to quit ‘Survivor’&nbsp;</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jeff-Probst-wife-Lisa-Ann-Russell-ss-post-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Although Jeff has been a mainstay of the long-running series since it first began, Lisa apparently nudged her husband toward walking away from the program. According to a 2017 article from&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Radar Online</a>, the mother-of-two was hoping her beau would finally walk away from the series. “Jeff loves his crazy job and the very peaceful home life he goes home to when he’s not shooting, but his wife, Lisa, wants him home permanently,” a source shared with the outlet. “Now that her kids are teenagers, Lisa needs his help more than ever. She says the family doesn’t need the Survivor&nbsp;money and that they’re completely set for life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Despite Lisa’s alleged hints at wanting her husband to get off the&nbsp;Survivor&nbsp;island, Jeff is still seemingly full steam ahead, telling <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Parade </a>in a recent article that the show’s new formular has bred “a faster, more dangerous and much more intense game.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8menZ9loKe8o7%2FTZq6inpVigXaClnFucGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-reunite-met-gala-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See Photo Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chiwetel-ejiofor-19770710-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chiwetel Ejiofor (Movie Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
