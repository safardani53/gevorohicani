is Money Man?&nbsp;</h2><p>Money Man, born Tyson Jay Bolding, is a 35-year-old American rapper.</p><p>His career began after his creation of Black Circle Family, which was his independent label named after his acclaimed debut album in 2016, Black Circle.</p><p>His 2016 debut solo single, Boss Up, and 2017 tune How It Feel garnered public attention, as well as interest from Cash Money Records.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, he became Cash Money’s newest signee, and wasted no time to drop not one but three consecutive mixtapes with the label in under six months.</p><p>While his new music was gaining him interest, it was his departure from Cash Money that remained the most discussed aspect.</p><p>Not only did he choose to leave a successful label company, he had to pay out a quarter of a million dollars to do so.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Money Man has stated that there was no bad intentions or reasonings behind leaving the label, it was just because he wanted to venture on his own.</p><p>He has since worked with high-profile artists, which has allowed him to reach a high level of financial success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000692710732.jpg><h2>What is Money Man's net worth?&nbsp;</h2><p>According to various sources, Money Man has a <a href=#>net worth </a>estimated between $2 and $5 million.</p><p>His Paranoia mixtape peaked at number 36 on the <a href=#>Billboard </a>200 chart back in 2019.</p><p>His rhythmic way of rapping and unique way of producing beats has made him the successful rapper he is today.&nbsp;</p><p>After the hit of his virals like 24 Hours which was released 2020, the series of viral tracks is continuing.</p><p>He is rapidly growing and soaring high as an artist, so we can expect more successes to come.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why is Money Man being paid in Bitcoin?</h2><p>Empire Record Label is offering artists the option to receive the money in <a href=#>Bitcoin</a> through Cash App.</p><p>The company announced on Tuesday, November 9, that this would be the new way forward after the first artist to receive it was Money Man,</p><p>According to the company, Money Man took a $1million advance through the decentralized digital currency.</p><p>This equates to just under 15 Bitcoin at current valuation.</p><p>Money Man has been open about his investments in <a href=#>cryptocurrency</a> in the past and even posted Instagram stories explaining how to invest.</p><p>He states that he used the profits from his early dip into Bitcoin to help buy himself out of his Cash Money Records deal a few years ago.</p><p>This new advance payment option will be a new way to “innovate financial tools” for the artists that work with it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Empire founder/CEO Ghazi Shami told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a>: “Money Man is a progressive thinker and has his thumb on the crypto pulse.</p><p>"It felt organic to start with him as our first-ever artist to receive an Empire advance in BTC as we begin to innovate financial tools for our partners.”</p><p class=postsid
