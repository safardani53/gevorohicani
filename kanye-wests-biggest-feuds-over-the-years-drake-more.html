Over the years, <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong> </a>has remained outspoken about his opinions — and he isn’t afraid to stand up against naysayers.</p><p class=p1>While the Yeezy designer and <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a> were once close friends and collaborators, <a href=#>the duo’s bond quickly faded</a> after<a href=#><strong> Pusha-T</strong></a> called out the Canada native on his “Infrared” single in 2018, which was produced by West.</p><p class=p1>“Then, the first album drops,” Drake <a href=#>recalled during an interview on HBO’s&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>The Shop</a>&nbsp;</i>in October 2018. “And, of course, there’s a diss song toward me that you produced, that’s talking about writing? I was just there with you as friends helping you, and now you’re dissing me. So I’m like, man, this is dark.”</p><p class=p1>Since then, the pair has continued to go toe-to-toe whether they’re calling one another out via social media or in a verse on one of their tracks.</p><p class=p1>Drake even alleged that the Illinois native leaked the news of <a href=#>his son Adonis’ birth</a> before he officially announced it.</p><p class=p1>“I tell him I’m having trouble with my son’s mother. We had a conversation,”&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Degrassi&nbsp;</i>alum told&nbsp;<i>The Shop,&nbsp;</i>referring to his ex <a href=#><strong>Sophie Brussaux</strong></a>.<i>&nbsp;</i>“I wake up, and all these dates are out … Then the next two days, whatever, I wake up now to this text from him, passive, like, ‘Yo, I love you brother.’”</p><p class=p1>After years of silence on the matter,&nbsp;the “Gold Digger” musician <a href=#>seemingly reignited their beef</a> after including a shady callout to the “One Dance” performer on<a href=#> his 10th album</a>,&nbsp;<i>DONDA,&nbsp;</i>which was released in August 2021.</p><p class=p1>West’s <a href=#>“Pure Souls” single</a> included the lyric, “It’s gotta be God’s plan&nbsp;/ Man, I swear these boys keep playin’ / We gon’ have to square up then,”&nbsp;which eagle-eyed fans thought it referenced the bad blood between the musicians.</p><p class=p1>Drake <a href=#>seemingly tossed shade right back weeks later</a> on his&nbsp;<i>Certified Lover Boy&nbsp;</i>LP. Though the “Hotline Bling” musician didn’t call out West by name, he did reference a rapper who’s also a designer on his “7am On Bridle Path” song.</p><p class=p1>“Told you I’m aimin’ straight for the head&nbsp;/&nbsp;Not aiming to please,”&nbsp;Drake rapped on the track. “I can give a f—k about who designing your <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> and tees / Have somebody put you on a Gildan and you play with my seed.”</p><p class=p1>Drake’s not the only star taking shots at West. Shortly after <a href=#>the&nbsp;<i>DONDA</i>&nbsp;release</a>, the official Twitter account for Peppa Pig seemingly shared a shady message for the father of four — he shares <a href=#>North</a>, <a href=#>Saint</a>, <a href=#>Chicago</a> and <a href=#>Psalm</a> with <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> — in a now-deleted message.</p><p class=p1>“Peppa didn’t need to <a href=#>host listening parties in Mercedes-Benz Stadium</a> to get that .5,”&nbsp;the account for the children’s TV series wrote at the time, alongside side-by-side screenshots of reviews of&nbsp;<i>DONDA&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Peppa’s Adventures: The Album.</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Though West never publicly addressed his so-called beef with the animated series, he has commented on <a href=#>several of his famous feuds</a> with other big names in the entertainment industry.</p><p class=p1>Keep scrolling for more details on the “Heartless” rapper’s biggest feuds over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bgrq%2FFxGaunqukqHqjtcagnKysXZuytrDSZqavnaJiwamxjLKcmqqjYrGzrcqeZKanopp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./matt-house-wife-jessi-house-kids-lsu-fired-the-coach.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matt House Wife Jessi House And Kids: LSU Fired The Coach</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-theroux-and-sienna-miller-reunite-in-n-y-c-after-hanging-together-in-france.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Theroux, Sienna Miller Reunite in N.Y.C.
