will resent her for her past lifestyle.</p><p>"Otherwise, her life's never going to be the same.</p><p>"She'll have a job that pays 18 cents an hour, will be woken up for head counts at 3 am, and will have to get up for the day around 5 am.</p><p>"Each day she'll get ten minutes of phone calls and $12 spending money.</p><p>"She'll be able to dye her hair either blonde, red, or black and buy cheap makeup.</p><p>"She'll be wearing plain sweats when she's inside her unit and a uniform that she puts on.</p><p>"And right now she'll get a coat for the rest of the winter and it's really cold inside.</p><p>"The prison is a minimum-security camp for women but it'll be a blow to Jen's system.</p><p>"She's going to go to something that she has never, ever experienced because before Jen lived a luxury lifestyle."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

that many could only dream of.</p><p>While since first appearing in the hit reality show in 2020, Jen was never coy about showing off her wealth.</p><p>The businesswoman was often seen throwing plenty of glam parties and wearing expensive clothes.</p><p>And despite being fairly secretive about her job, while living in her Shah Ski Chalet for two seasons, the $ 3.9 million property in Utah later turned out to be rented.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Holli.</p><p>"Everybody thinks these types of camps are easy.</p><p>"People do call it 'camp cupcake' but these camps aren't a soft option.</p><p>"Each facility has its own handbook, so Jen will be given that when she arrives.</p><p>"She's going to be required to take classes for rehabilitation and will have to understand that her daily life will be different now.</p><p>"She'll have to learn how email works, and how the phone works where she'll only get 300 minutes of calls a month.</p><p>"Jen will only be able to communicate with certain people in the outside world.</p><p>"There are a ton of written and unwritten rules she'll have to learn," adds Holli.</p><p>"On a typical day, the lights will come on at 5 am.</p><p>"There are counts where officers come in and count through 24 hours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

everybody.</p><p>"She doesn't have to be up, but she does have to be on her bed.</p><p>"This is a nationwide count so it happens at the same time.</p><p>"Breakfast is at 6 am when the dining hall may be open for five minutes or ten minutes.</p><p>"It depends on what the manager or the officer on duty that day wants to run it.</p><p>"Jen cannot take any food out and this will be her one chance to get a cup of coffee and work will start.</p><p>"The food she'll have and can also get from the commissary include things like oatmeal and jam, rice, bagels, and beans.</p><p>"At 10.30 am she'll have lunch and at 3 pm they'll have everybody come back to their unit to be counted.</p><p>"It's dinner at 4 pm.</p><p>"After that period of time, that's when programming (which are classes) and or she's going to have time on her hands.</p><p>"If she doesn't have that, she'll be allowed to go to the legal library or go walk to the track or go to the chapel.</p><p>"In the evening at 9 pm, there's another count which is a standing count.</p><p>"So she'll have to stand in front of her cubicle to be counted.</p><p>"After that, the officers turn the lights up and so it doesn't mean that she has to go to bed.</p><p>"She could go take her chair from her cubicle and watch TV in the TV room.</p><p>"The phones and email are also turned off at 9 pm and then she'll have another count at midnight when she has to be in her bed.</p><p>"And then there's the monotony."</p><p>In the run-up to her incarceration and <a href=#>Bravo </a>had featured Jen's ongoing legal issues during the program's second

turning down a pre-incarceration interview possibility with TV host Andy Cohen.</p><p>At the time she said: “I promised myself and my loving family that I would not allow this portion of my life to be sensationalized or inaccurately conveyed.”</p><p>Jen went on to add: “Too many people have been hurt by my actions and my inability to control my own narrative.”</p><p>"Just because Jen goes to prison, it doesn't mean that her life's over, " <a aria-label="says Holli who supports convicted women in the run-up to incarceration (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>says Holli
