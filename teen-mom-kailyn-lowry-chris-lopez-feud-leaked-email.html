Do better."</p><h2>'MOVE ON!'</h2><p>Kailyn was <a href=#>slammed for sharing a "bitter" post</a> about "being a villain" after Chris welcomed a baby with another woman.</p><p>Chris announced earlier this week that&nbsp;<a href=#>his new partner has given birth to a son</a>.</p><p>Just hours after the news emerged,&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>&nbsp;star Kailyn posted a cryptic quote on her Instagram Stories about her attitude to next year.</p><p>She shared a post that read: "For 2022, I decided to be the villain. I'm so excited. Y'all pissed me off all year."</p><p>While the mother-of-four did not mention Chris by name, fans were convinced she was being "bitter" about his baby news.</p><p>One wrote on a Teen Mom Reddit thread: "Oh here we go I was wondering how long it would take Kail to shade Chris. Cue ten thousand salty quotes."</p><p>Another added: "She literally can't help herself can she? Even when she's not talking about him she's talking about him."</p><p>"Embarrassing. Stop being obsessed with your ex," a third posted.</p><p>Chris announced he had become a father for a third time via his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">P.T.S.D</a>&nbsp;podcast, which came out on Tuesday.</p><p>He didn't reveal exactly when his baby mama - whose name is not known - gave birth, but said he's relishing being more involved as a father this time round.</p><p>"I love being a dad, I promise you. I experience more with the third one than I have with the others. It feels crazy, it feels good," he said.</p><p>"I got to be a part of it more than I ever have."</p><p>His co-host exclaimed in response: "Three kids! Three boys."</p><p>Chris went on: "I love kids. I've always gotten along with kids, I don't know how. They know how to have fun. They're so innocent."</p><p>He also slammed Kailyn for announcing that he was going to be having a child with his baby mama, accusing her of trying to "destroy" his "peace".</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>MTV</a>&nbsp;star said: "Regardless of situations... like it came out... I don't even care. You ain't about to destroy some peace.</p><p>"I'm just trying to be as peaceful as possible. Leave me the f**k alone."</p><h2>NASTY FEUD</h2><p>Kailyn and Chris' relationship has been tense for years, even resulting in a&nbsp;<a href=#>child custody</a>&nbsp;court hearing.</p><p>In September of 2020, Kailyn was also&nbsp;<a href=#>arrested after "punching Chris</a>&nbsp;several times with a closed fist" after he cut Lux's hair without her permission.</p><p>Meanwhile, in October, Kailyn&nbsp;<a href=#>accused him of partying in Miami</a>&nbsp;instead of paying Creed's medical bills.</p><p><a href=#>Kailyn&nbsp;lashed out at her baby daddy</a>&nbsp;- who appeared to be on vacation in Florida with friends - in a lengthy rant on her Instagram Stories.</p><p>She said: "You should take care of your financial obligations to your children before going on a trip to Miami."</p><p>Meanwhile, earlier this week, Chris claimed he has been&nbsp;<a href=#>banned from filming with his sons</a>&nbsp;on the new season of Teen Mom 2.</p><p>During an Instagram Live, a fan asked: "Are you filming with your kids at all?"</p><p>Chris replied: "I told y'all I was told I can't, somebody told me I can't film with my kids. So I'm not filming with my kids."</p><p>MTV&nbsp;had allegedly&nbsp;<a href=#>hired Chris for the show</a>&nbsp;without telling Kailyn and she&nbsp;<a href=#>berated the network</a>&nbsp;for how they "handled" the situation.</p><h2>'UPS & DOWNS'</h2><p>Chris admitted on social media that <a href=#>co-parenting with the reality star</a> has had "its ups and downs."</p><p>In the Instagram Story, a&nbsp;Teen Mom 2&nbsp;fan asked: "Is it easy co-parenting? Or sometimes is it hard?"</p><p>Chris confessed that co-parenting had its share of "ups and downs."</p><p>The reality star realized that he was "just learning as I go."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Kailyn shares sons Lux, four, and Creed, one, with her former partner.</p><p>She also has Isaac, 11, with Jo Rivera and Lincoln seven, with Javi Marroquin.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000697761238.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000615100537.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000640461191.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Teen Mom Kailyn Lowry's ex Chris Lopez claims he was BANNED from filming with their two sons in new season of MTV show</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYW6EeYGUaKuenZ5iurC5jKSYoqSpo3qtu9arsGabmKe2tHnLqKeesl2bsrawjKWcmqOVmXqmucCio2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./xy2hbexec8icov-pzw-fbvkazlx5rwcu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Dora the Explorer Season 6 Episode 18: Dora's Enchanted Forest Adventures Parts 2 and 3: Dora</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yqnhcyrs-wkh4sg9l0dy35eoupll4cnh.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
