By the following year, however, things appeared to turn sour.</p><p>In 2010, Swift penned “Dear John,” a <a href=#>not-so-subtle breakup anthem</a> detailing a romance with an older man. (When they were rumored to be dating, the Pennsylvania native was 19 and Mayer was 32.)</p><p>“Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong / Don’t you think 19 is too young / To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so? / I should’ve known,” she sings, instantly causing dedicated Swifties to believe she was referencing the “Daughters” crooner.</p><p>Elsewhere in the track, Swift reflects, “Well maybe it’s me and my blind optimism to blame / Maybe it’s you and your sick need to give love then take it away / And you’ll add my name to your long list of traitors who don’t understand / And I’ll look back and regret how I ignored when they said ‘run as fast as you can.'”</p><p>Before his brief connection with the “Cardigan” songstress, Mayer was linked to <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Love Hewitt</strong>, <strong>Jessica Simpson</strong>, <strong>Minka Kelly</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>. He had also been the subject of a number of controversies, including <a href=#>comparing Simpson to “sexual napalm”</a> and <a href=#>using the N-word</a> in a 2010 Playboy interview. (He has since apologized.)</p><p>While Swift <a href=#>hasn’t frequently discussed her history</a> with Mayer, the “Assassin” singer didn’t hold back about how “Dear John” made him feel. In 2012, he told Rolling Stone that he was “humiliated” by the lyrics, calling it “cheap songwriting” to directly reference an ex. The following year, however, he appeared to do something similar on his song “Paper Doll,” which fans assume is about the CMA Award winner.</p><p>Though he initially wasn’t happy with being used as Swift’s inspiration, Mayer later told pal <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> that he’d be “jazzed” if his exes still wrote about him.</p><p>“Sometimes, I hope it’s about me. Sometimes, it’s a really good song,” the “Slow Dancing in a Burning Room” artist said in February 2021. “I don’t think it’s a dirty admission. Sometimes, a song is so good, I go, ‘Man, I hope that’s about me.’ … I’ll check everyone’s music out. I’m a fan.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift, for her part, <a href=#>doesn’t particularly care</a> how her music makes her former flames feel. While promoting Red (Taylor’s Version) in November 2021, she told <a href=#><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></a>, “I haven’t thought about their experience, to be honest.”</p><p>Scroll down for a look back at the musicians’ messy history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecCnm2ain527brnAspyrq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uwMimnKWhnpp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ewan-mcgregor-mary-elizabeth-winsteads-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Relationship Timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ruby2smooth-pqic-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>ruby2smooth (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
