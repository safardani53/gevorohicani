Users claim that theaters are preventing movie goers from seeing the film.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Angel Studios</a></figure><p>The controversy surrounding <a href=#>Sound of Freedom</a> continues to grow, just days after the film was released. The faith-based thriller centers around the work of former federal agent, Tim Ballard, who has dedicated his life to stopping child trafficking. In the film, produced by Eduardo Verástegui, Tim is played by The Passion of the Christ star Jim Caviezel.</p><p>Sound of Freedom has garnered mixed reviews from critics. The drama scored a 100 percent audience score on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a> but was slammed by critics like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>. Jim addressed the backlash the film has received and suggested that media members are trying to distract from the film’s message.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Angel Studios</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's the 'Sound of Freedom' theater controversy?</h2><p>“They’re scared. Quaking in their boots. And it’s because the public are listening to their hearts, which is what this film tells you to do,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>. “We’re being shafted by mainstream media.”</p><p>Jim is not the only one who believes that someone is conspiring to influence potential moviegoers. TikTokers have taken to the social media platform to share their experience at theaters and the videos are quite suggestive.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTokers believe movie theaters are being sabotaged!</h2><p>Like Jim, users of TikTok have also suggested that someone is trying to stop people from seeing Sound of Freedom. TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@jamskillet</a> recalled his experience at an AMC theater on July 4, and explained that when he bought his tickets online the movie was nearly sold out. He then goes on to claim that when he arrived at the movie theater, the room was nearly empty.</p><p>“So, AMC and Regal, the people who own it are not running AC and they're making it harder to get tickets,” he said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jamskillet href=#>@jamskillet</a><p>The Silencening of Freedom <a title=amc href=#>#amc</a> <a title=soundoffreedom href=#>#soundoffreedom</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Jamskillet" href=#>♬ original sound - Jamskillet</a></figure><p>Another TikTok user, by the name <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@bleighve1112 </a>, allegedly had a similar experience at an AMC location in Pineville, N.C. She claims that her party pre-ordered tickets to Sound of Freedom, but received a refund prior to the start of the film. The TikToker claims they later arrived at the theater and were told that their showing was cancelled because there was no air conditioning in the screening rooms.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@bleighve1112 href=#>@bleighve1112</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Bleighve1112" href=#>♬ original sound - Bleighve1112</a></figure><p>"There was air conditioning in the lobby. There was air conditioning in the hallways. There was air conditioning in the bathrooms, but not the theaters?” the TikToker questioned. Adding, “I smell something stinky.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">AMC Theaters has denied any wrongdoing.</h2><p>AMC Theaters CEO, Adam Aron, has since slammed reports that claim the company is limiting showings of Sound of Freedom. He addressed the conspiracies in a statement posted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, writing, “Yesterday we showed that movie 3,000 times at our 570 U.S. theatres, and more than 100,000 people watched it.” He went on to suggest that the rumors were simply “misinformation.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Angel Studios</a></figure><p>Despite the controversy, Sound of Freedom has made a big impression at the big office. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a>, the film has grossed over $53 million and shows no signs of slowing down. The movie, which is based on the life of Operation Underground Railroad founder Tim Ballard, also received an A+ on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinema Score</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLy2usNmpp9llqeyprDOpmStoJWWwaa%2BjKmpqJqcmrq0ecKopa2qn6uys7%2FY</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./heather-rae-el-moussa-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are Heather Rae El Moussa's Parents?
