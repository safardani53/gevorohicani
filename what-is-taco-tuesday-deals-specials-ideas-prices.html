However, the history of the taco day is a bit more complicated than some may think.</p><p>Celebrated all across the US from Los Angeles to rural parts of the country, this food holiday is a beloved one for most.</p><p>Some may wonder why it is specifically Taco Tuesday and not any other day of the week. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taco Tuesday® was trademarked</a> in 1989 by Mexican restaurant chain Taco John's.</p><p>Taco John's may not be as well known as some other chains like Taco Bell because it is based in Wyoming and its other locations only exist in the Mid West portion of the US.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>Their website reads, "Ever hear of Taco Tuesday®? We started it! We even trademarked it. That’s how seriously we take tacos."</p><p>The chain has even threatened legal action to other restaurants using the phrase. Some people argue that it is ubiquitous to trademark such a phrase as Taco Tuesday.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thrillist </a>reports that attempting to pinpoint the exact creator of the phrase is sure to send you on long spiral of hearsay and claims that Taco John's "doesn't know what it's talking about."</p><p>In fact, they addressed how Taco John's was not the first Mexican chain to offer Taco Tuesday specials.</p><p>"That honor went to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baker's Drive-Thru</a>, which operates in California's Inland Empire to this day and advertised a taco special on Tuesday as early as 1967. Their first Taco Tuesday campaign seems to date to 1976. “Why are Tuesdays special?” read an ad in the November 2, 1976, edition of the&nbsp;Progress Bulletin&nbsp;in Pomona. "They're TACO TUESDAYS at Baker's.”"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/SUNFEA_gettyimages-468542762jpg-JS184946321-1.jpg><h2>How is Taco Tuesday celebrated?</h2><p>Many acknowledge Taco Tuesday on a weekly basis and celebrate by eating the popular Mexican food at their local restaurants or chains with the best deals.</p><p>Taco Tuesdays are often accompanied by margarita specials and other combination deals.</p><p>Not to be confused with <a href=#>National Taco Day</a> which was on Monday Oct. 4 this year.</p><p>Most restaurants offer a Taco Tuesday special every week.</p><h2>Where can you get the best Taco Tuesday deals?</h2><p>Many chains offer Taco Tuesday deals across the US, some restaurants like Rubio's offers specials on a weekly basis.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rubio's Taco</a> Tuesday begin after 2.30pm and include The Original Fish Taco® for $1.75, The Fish Taco Especial for $2, and the Shrimp Trio for $7.99. Location prices may vary.</p><p>Although not a Taco Tuesday special but a taco special nonetheless, on Nov. 4 Taco Bell will be giving away <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">free Doritos® Locos Tacos</a> all day.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Local restaurants typically also offer their own Taco Tuesday deal, like the Southern California chain El Torito. On Tuesdays starting at 3pm they offer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$2.99 made-to-order tacos</a> with handmade tortillas.</p><p>From 3pm - 1pm <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Del Taco</a> also offers their own Taco Tuesday where you can get three value tacos for $1.49.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfaIZ5gJhraGivmJbBbrXSZquam59iwbax0p2YsmWUmq6tv4ysp56bmZa5tHnInZyaq12lv6qvxKxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celtic-atletico-madrid-live-stream-score-result-champions-league.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celtic vs Atletico Madrid LIVE SCORE: Champions League latest as Bhoys host Spanish giants in need o</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vikki-dougan-6es7-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vikki Dougan (Movie Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
