It was definitely created a little bit of a competitive edge because there's got to be one bachelor guy standing at the end of it all," the TV personality spilled while promoting the new season.</p><p>When asked if he knew of any other contestants from Bachelor Nation who were asked to be on the show, Tyler said he “heard they asked <a href=#>Jason Tartick</a>.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Tyler Cameron">Read More on Tyler Cameron</h2><p>However, Tyler claimed he ultimately didn’t make it because Jason “was too weak and weak-minded to go on.”</p><p>This would have been prior to Jason's breakup with <a href=#>Kaitlyn Bristowe</a> given filming occurred in June and the former couple announced their split in August.</p><p>Jason's manager denied Tyler's claim in a statement to The U.S. Sun.</p><p>"At no point did Special Forces ever reach out to Jason for an opportunity to go on the show," he stated.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2><strong>BACHELOR BREAKUP</strong></h2><p>Jason, 34, and Kaitlyn, 38, <a href=#>announced their decision to end their engagement</a> on August 6.</p><p>The season 14 <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> contestant and season 11 <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> lead got engaged back in May 2021 after dating for two years.</p><p>The former couple shared a&nbsp;photo&nbsp;of themselves on their <a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;feed along with a lengthy caption.</p><p>The post began: "After sharing the news with family and close friends first, and taking the time to properly process it ourselves, we are saddened with heavy hearts to share that we have decided to end our engagement.</p><p>"We are thankful for all of you who gave us the time and space to process this life altering decision as there are many emotions and changes to navigate."</p><p>Their statement continued: "Continuing our friendship is incredibly important to both of us. We feel grateful to be ending our engagement with love and respect for each other.</p><p>"It’s heartbreaking and sad to say goodbye, but our care and admiration for one another will never die."</p><h2><strong>SPECIAL OPS TRAINING</strong></h2><p>The cast of Special Forces season two includes: Tyler, Nick, <a href=#>Tom Sandoval</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Blac Chyna</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>JoJo Siwa</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Savannah Chrisley</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jack Osbourne</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kelly Rizzo</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Bode Miller</a>, <a href=#>Tara Reid</a>, NFL star Dez Bryant, <a href=#>NBA</a> star Robert Horry and Olympic gold medalist Erin Jackson.</p><p>Prior to the cast going to the secluded filming location, the potential candidates must pass various tests.</p><p>Last season, the cast filmed in the Jordanian desert in the Middle East in 125-degree weather.</p><p>This season, the cast filmed in the freezing <a href=#>New Zealand</a> mountains.</p><p>Dr. Drew Pinsky, who was part of season one, previously <a href=#>shared insight with The U.S. Sun</a> about the training program.</p><p>He said that it included weight packs of about 35 to 40 pounds, running hills and sprinting.</p><p>The potential candidates also have to take cardiac tests and do "all kinds of psychological testing."</p><p>Although Dr. Drew went through a two-week program in season one, it seems like things changed for the second season.</p><p><a href=#>Tyler told The U.S. Sun</a> that he was only given "a week-and-a -half" heads up that he was going to go on the show.</p><p>"I didn't have much time to prepare for it, but mentally, I read David Goggin's book (Never Finished).</p><p>"I was just trying to get whatever advice I could get about mental toughness and preparing for hell week and stuff like that," he shared.</p><h2><strong>'HARDEST THING'</strong></h2><p>Once cast for the show, each celebrity must partake in a challenge that the directing staff will either give them a pass or fail.</p><p>There is no elimination ceremony, unlike <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>, as every celebrity is on the show until they choose to leave or get injured.</p><p>Although he couldn't spoil the ending, Tyler told The U.S. Sun that <a href=#>there were "many dark days"</a> and he didn't know if he could keep going.</p><p>"The motive on the show was just, I wanted to challenge myself, but also get away a little bit.</p><p>"I was beat up from working in South Florida and the hot summer."</p><p>He added: "I was like, 'Oh, this will be a nice little vacation.' It was way harder than a vacation I ever [experienced].</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"It was the hardest thing I've ever done.
