ban</a>, but should that come it is no problem as all she uses to tend her <a href=#>garden</a> is a vacuum cleaner.</p><img

£600 laying high-quality <a href=#>fake grass</a> to transform her garden and has imitation flowers, too.</p><p>She says: “Around 80 per cent of my garden is fake, which means it’s super-easy to look after and saves me a fortune on my water bill.</p><p>“And instead of having to regularly head out with my hosepipe, I vacuum my grass.</p><p>“Walking out in my garden with my trusty Dyson, most people would think I’m going to empty it or give it a clean.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON GARDENING">READ MORE ON GARDENING</h2><p>"Instead, I run the extension cord to its full length and use it on my garden.</p><p>“Within a few minutes, all the loose dirt, leaves and grit is sucked up and the grass is showroom perfect.”</p><p>Parts of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight are currently under a <a href=#>hosepipe ban</a>, while Sussex, Kent and Pembrokeshire are set to be hit with the same shortly.</p><p>But for people such as Dawne who have already ditched real grass for fake, this will never be an issue.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Insurance firm Aviva says one in ten homeowners now has a fake lawn, while a poll of Fabulous online readers found one in five readers would vacuum their lawns if this were an option.</p><p>During the covid lockdowns, demand for artificial grass soared — the number of Google searches during May 2020 had almost tripled the number a year before.</p><p>But conservationists worry about the environmental impact of plastic grass – it can’t be recycled, removes wildlife habitat and can contaminate the soil below.</p><p>And environmental gardening experts say plastic grass can make flooding worse and also get twice as hot as normal grass.</p><p>But Dawne says her mixture of fake grass and some real plants has worked well for her.</p><p>She says: “My garden is an amazing mix of real and faux and I reckon we have found the happy medium to keep everyone happy.</p><p>“We don’t have a hosepipe ban at the moment in South Wales, but if we do get one I’ll be OK.</p><p>"Lately, I’ve been driving past people’s houses with dry gardens.</p><h3>‘It’s the perfect lawn, no matter what the weather’</h3><p>“It makes me feel lucky I have a little patch of paradise with my faux turf and flowers.</p><p>"Having the greenery in this heat is really refreshing.</p><p>“While many people may think Hoovering the lawn is bonkers, for me it has been a weekly or fortnightly ritual since we laid our fake grass.”</p><p>Dawne has lived in her four-bedroom home in Bridgend with husband Stuart, 57, a car production manager, for 27 years.</p><p>They also have sons Casey, 22, and Corey, 21 — and raising two kids while trying to keep the garden in shape had been hard before they switched to synthetic.</p><p>Dawne says: “When we first moved into the house, it had a huge backyard covered in normal grass which took hours to mow.</p><p>“But with a full-time job and two lively lads I never had much time for my gardening.</p><p>“So ten years ago I decided it was time to turn the garden into a mini-island paradise but on a budget.</p><p>“My husband watched YouTube tutorials and built our own gazebo — but that was just the start.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

part of the lawn with decking.</p><p>But Dawne was still not happy with the lawn.</p><p>She says: “Bordered by the decking, it looked scruffy and wouldn’t grow properly.</p><p>“So we decided to lay artificial grass to give it uniformity and year-round colour.”</p><p>She says: “I researched the fake turf available. I learnt that if you skimp and buy cheaply it gets mouldy, slippery and doesn’t last.</p><p>“Ten years on, thanks to regular Hoovering, it looks as good as it did the day it was laid.</p><h3>‘Neighbours thought I’d lost the plot’</h3><p>“It’s the perfect lawn, no matter what the weather, and doesn’t need mowing or watering, which is great with the soaring <a href=#>costs of water bills</a> and the recent <a href=#>dry spell</a> we’ve had.</p><p>“I just have a quick whiz over it all with the Hoover. It doesn’t have any effect on my electricity bill, it’s a minimal cost.”</p><p>At first, neighbours were shocked to see Dawne Hoovering her grass.</p><p>She says: “They thought I’d lost the plot. I would see them looking through their windows.</p><p>"One did ask me what I was doing. But when I explained, they thought it was a brilliant idea.</p><p>“Now everyone’s doing it. It means we spend less time weeding and mowing.”</p><p>Over the past five years Dawne has also spent £500 buying more than 200 fake blooms.</p><p>She says: “I get them on eBay or Amazon and in the last few years the quality of so-called plastic flowers has risen dramatically.</p><p>“They sell in bunches for around £4 and once you start using them you won’t look back. I rotate them among the real plants.</p><p>“When seedlings are slow to grow you can pop in plastic plants and it instantly creates a fuller, more lush-looking garden.</p><p>“The plastic flowers simply need a wash or dust and if you rotate them regularly they don’t fade in the sun.</p><p>“And when winter comes you can still enjoy flowers.</p><p>“Most of my friends even have trouble telling the difference between the real flowers and the fake ones.”</p><p>Her garden also has a bargain water feature she bought on sale for a third of its original price.</p><p>She says: “I’ve always been keen on saving money and wanted a water feature like the type you see in posh hotel resorts.</p><p>One did ask me what I was doing. But when I explained, they thought it was a brilliant idea.</p><span class=quote-credit>Dawne Deeks</span><p>" I finally found the perfect one, ex-display at a local garden centre. It retails for £3,500, I got it for £1,500.”</p><p>Dawne and Stuart also have a gravelled area in their garden, which they laid themselves, and a barbecue area.</p><p>She gets a lot of her garden plants and accessories free on Facebook Marketplace, or cheap from budget stores such as the Poundshop.</p><p>She says: “I see people spending tens of thousands on gardens and look at mine and am proud we’ve done it all ourselves.</p><p>“If you put in some fake grass and invest in quality plastic plants — as well as the real ones — you can see your garden take shape in just a few days.</p><p>“The garden instantly becomes usable, especially with young children, and you have more space for the family to enjoy.</p><p>“I know some people are against faux turf.</p><p>“But my garden is always sparkling, plus it can be used all year round.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“The initial cost might seem a lot but you will never have to spend it again, and it will save thousands on your water bill and always look perfect.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“All it needs is a quick vacuum — and then you can relax with a cocktail.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">But should you fake it?</h3></p><p><strong>SUN gardening expert Veronica Lorraine writes: Sadly, although it may look fab for the first couple of years, fake grass does absolutely nothing to encourage crucial wildlife and add biodiversity to a garden.</strong></p><p>It strips insects of their homes, denies worms and birds food and sounds the death knell for the soil underneath.</p><p>Fake turf has a lifespan – and whether it’s five or 15 years it will end up as a dreaded landfill, as it can’t be recycled.</p><p>It also has a huge carbon footprint. And it still gets really hot in a heatwave.</p><p>With a hosepipe ban looming, and hotter, drier weather becoming the future, the fact it doesn’t need constant watering is definitely a plus – and it doesn’t need mowing, which saves on electricity.</p><p>There’s also no need for controversial fertilisers or feeds.</p><p>But ultimately I’d say it’s just not worth the cost – either financially or environmentally.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>CUT-PRICE FALSIES</h2><p>SHOULD you decide to take inspiration from Dawne, here are some deals on artificial grass to style up your garden...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/8e01356b-b373-449f-abfa-31bba21a5c94.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1adc5334-edfd-4fbe-8d9a-518da810b81a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/15371048-9fc6-4b4c-af5f-65d3ac094cbe.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/d40940e1-07b7-4161-92fa-35b1cec61279.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000751744549.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Bya29sZmt9cMLAnKyupV2hrri6jJ%2BYpJ1dnL%2Biv9Jmn6irlaW2sbGO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-shows-off-thin-frame-bra-thong.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian shows off thin frame in see-through white mesh bra &amp;amp; thong after ex Kanye West SPLITS</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./young-royals-season-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Has Season 2 of 'Young Royals' Been Greenlit by Netflix Yet?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
