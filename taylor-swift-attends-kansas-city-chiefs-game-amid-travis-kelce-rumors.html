Swift sported a T-shirt in the team’s red and white colors as she sat next to Kelce’s mom, <a href=#><strong>Donna Kelce</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>Rumors first swirled that Swift was dating the Chiefs tight end after he <a href=#>watched her<i> Eras Tour </i>concert</a> at his team’s stadium — and wanted to connect with her backstage.</p><p class=p1>“She doesn’t meet anybody — or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal. But it was an unbelievable show. Kansas City showed out,” Travis said during <a href=#>a July episode of his “New Heights”</a> podcast. “Everybody was dressed in pink and purple, going crazy for her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/taylor-swift-attends-kansas-city-chiefs-game-amid-travis-kelce-rumors-003.jpg><p class=p1>He continued: “Well, I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butt-hurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her.”</p><p class=p1>After his brother, <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, pressed what <a href=#>type of friendship bracelets</a> they were, Travis revealed he crafted one with his phone number on it.</p><p class=p1>While Travis was unable to gift his DIY bracelets to Swift, rumors continued to heat up after various outlets reported that the duo had been out on a couple of dates together. NFL announcers <a href=#>even played into the speculation</a> earlier this month, making references to Swift’s lyrics whenever Travis scored a touchdown.</p><p class=p1>Jason, 35, however, was <a href=#>confused about their relationship status</a> — but thinks it could be true.</p><p class=p1>“It is hard to answer because<a href=#> I don’t really know a lot about</a> what is happening in Travis’ love life. I try to, like, keep his business [as] his business and straight out of that world,” Jason, who <a href=#>plays football for the Philadelphia Eagles</a>, quipped on Philadelphia’s WIP Morning Show on Wednesday, September 20. “Having said that. … I think it is 100 percent true.”</p><p class=p1>One day later, Travis acknowledged <a href=#>his sibling’s remarks</a> — while offering an update on the potential romance.</p><p class=p1>“I told her, ‘You know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit,’” Travis <a href=#>said on “The Pat McAfee Show”</a> on Thursday, September 21. “So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Prior to his interest in Swift, Travis last dated <a href=#><strong>Kayla Nicole</strong></a> on and off for several years. He also searched for love on his own reality dating show, <a href=#><i>Catching Kelce</i></a>, in 2016.</p><p class=p1>The Grammy winner, for her part, has been single since May when <i>Us Weekly </i>confirmed <a href=#>she had ended her fling</a> with <a href=#><strong>Matty Healy</strong></a>.
