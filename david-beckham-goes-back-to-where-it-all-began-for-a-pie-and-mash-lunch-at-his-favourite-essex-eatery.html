Becks looked happy and at home with his east end treat and reminded me of all the time's I've been there with my grandad, who has the exact same order. A favourite haunt of the world's most recognised footballer and locals alike, Becks is a regular (as regular as a star who lives in L.A. can be). Tucking in to double pie n mash with liqueur and a side of jellied eels. David even had some chilli vinegar to help slurp the eels down with. And I can confirm that there is no better comfort food that reminds you of family - as well as being really tasty!</p><p>Shop owner Tony Lane explained at the time: “He has brought his family here as well. Victoria doesn’t eat it, I don’t think she’s a pie and mash girl, but his boys seem to love it.</p><p>“David also loves jellied eels – but he doesn’t like the stewed version.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nintchdbpict000292424578.jpg><p>And Becks, who spends a lot of time&nbsp;in the States, said: "I always miss London. It is one of the reasons why when I am here I always go and have pie and mash with my mum or dad and also go and see my nan.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2eCeHyYcHBonJGrtqV5wZ6apKCRonqou8SsZJuZk6B6tbuMsJ%2BeqpVitrV5wKWjZpqVnK6vecWoqWaZXaW2pnnAp5tmpZGotW641KeaoWWRqXqptdJmnZqun6q%2FqsDEZpysq5Wteqat056psmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dwayne-fields.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Dwayne Fields net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bobby-pacquiao.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bobby Pacquiao</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
