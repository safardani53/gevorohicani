All that other stuff just falls apart,” the former <a href=#>America’s Got Talent </a>host exclusively told Us Weekly in April 2019. “I always want what’s best for my children.”</p><p>The California native <a href=#>told Us </a>one year prior that Carey was still his “homegirl.” The comedian gushed, “[She] always will be. Whatever she does, that’s Mariah Carey. She can do no wrong in my book.”</p><p>The actor also shares two children with <strong>Brittany Bell</strong> and <strong>Abby De La Rosa</strong>. Bell gave birth to son Golden and <a href=#>daughter Powerful</a> in February 2017 and December, respectively, while the DJ <a href=#>welcomed twin sons Zillion and Zion</a> in June 2021.</p><p>“Welcome to the world,” De La Rosa wrote via Instagram at the time, two months after <a href=#>revealing Cannon’s paternity</a>.</p><p>“I pray that God give you both the strength to walk brave and boldly in your individual truth just like your Daddy,” the entrepreneur wrote via Instagram in April 2021. “Your Dad and I will always be here for you both; in complete unison and support. No matter what this world may throw your way, know that forgiveness is key and what is for you — is for YOU! You both are already so loved, and we can’t wait to meet you both.”</p><p>De La Rosa previously wrote that she “reconnected” with Cannon in 2020. “Never would I have ever envisioned where we are at now. This isn’t a bs ‘love’ story, it’s a REAL story,” she told her Instagram followers. “His openness and honesty won my heart but above anything, he is my dearest friend and my partner [in] this world of mine. He changed my life in all the most unconventional ways, inspiring me to open my mind to the unknown when it came to loving outside of ‘labels’ and ‘ownership.'”</p><p>That same month, Us confirmed that model <strong>Alyssa Scott</strong> was <a href=#>pregnant with Cannon’s seventh child</a>. While celebrating <a href=#>Father’s Day</a>, the mom-to-be posted an Instagram Story photo of the rapper cradling her budding belly.</p><p>The duo’s baby boy<a href=#> died at 5 months old</a> of a brain tumor in December 2021. Scott was “amazing” during the tragedy, Cannon told his audience members at the time, saying, “[She’s] the strongest woman I’ve ever seen. We never had an argument. She was emotional when she needed to be but always was the best mom and continues to be the best mom.”</p><p>In January 2022, Cannon <a href=#>made headlines for hosting a baby shower</a> with <a href=#><strong>Bre Tiesi</strong></a>. He confirmed on his talk show the following day that<a href=#> his eighth child was on the way</a>, his first with the model. The pair welcomed their little one, a baby boy, in July of that year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Cannon announced in August 2022 that <a href=#>he and Bell are expecting their third child together</a>. One month later, they welcomed son Rise. The actor has since added daughters Beautiful Zeppelin and Halo Marie to his brood.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see sweet shots of Cannon’s children and their mothers over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNku6qvymaamqaepLu0ecWapKKkqWK6prHTZp%2Biq12Ytaq4w6ucp2WknbKqvoympq2glafAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./american-television-actress-jaz-sinclair-know-aboutt-her-affairs-and-dating-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>American Television actress Jaz Sinclair: Know aboutt her affairs and dating history</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-rapinoe-world-cup-victory-kiss-girlfriend-sue-bird.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Rapinoe's Celebratory World Cup Kiss with Girlfriend Sue Bird</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
