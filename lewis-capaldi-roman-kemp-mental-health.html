Sian is the party animal usually — I’ve seen her host a show with a plastic bucket next to her microphone — and Chris hasn’t done this before so I reckon he might get carried away.</p><p>“I’ll stick around and hang out but I know when to call it quits these days. As <a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a> sings, ‘Nothing happens after two’.”</p><p>The star, who also regularly presents <a href=#>The One Show</a> on BBC1, will be spending today’s build-up at a doctor’s clinic after damaging his knee, in the hope that painkilling injections will help him get through the show.</p><p>But it won’t stop him dancing along to the biggest names on the night as he backs <a href=#>Adam Lambert</a> to blow the roof off the stadium by performing Queen hits and Calvin to close the show in style.</p><p>Roman explains: “There’s something about the idea of Queen songs at Wembley that you can’t help getting excited by.</p><p>“And Calvin is just a megastar with so many hits. It’s going to be a banging show.”</p><p>Last year Roman’s pal <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> headlined — but the radio DJ barely recognised him when he recently bumped into the former One Direction heart-throb at a <a href=#>London </a>gym because he was looking so buff.</p><p>He revealed: “I saw him from behind, and it was only the tattoos that gave it away.</p><p>“He’s really muscled up. He looks good for it, but he joked that he looks like he’s joined <a href=#>Geordie Shore</a>.</p><p>“I’m sure his fans won’t complain.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Fury aimed at England</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a3f2caba-eb5d-4bad-a6ba-e933bd58a0ac.jpg><p>ENGLAND players who go up against boxer <a href=#>Tommy Fury</a> and the World XI in tomorrow’s <a href=#>Soccer Aid</a> need to watch out.</p><p>The former<a href=#> Love Islander</a> has warned he won’t be pulling any punches in the charity match.</p><p>He said in an exclusive chat at a training session yesterday: “There will be bones shed.</p><p>“I will be slide-tackling hard. There will be no love lost on Sunday.”</p><p>Tommy was joined by fellow ex-Love Islander<a href=#> Kem Cetinay</a>, and the pair let slip they had been up at 4am – but insisted it wasn’t at one of Soccer Aid’s notorious pre-match parties.</p><p>Instead, Tommy said their late night was because they were at <a href=#>Manchester United</a>’s Old Trafford stadium, training for the annual match which has raised more than £75million for Unicef since it began in 2006.</p><p>Kem said: “We were at the gym at 4am. He has been on at me. He said, ‘Kem, no drinking, no unhealthy food’.”</p><p>Along with Tommy, <a href=#>Joel Corry</a> is also making his debut at the game, playing for England.</p><p>He and team-mate <a href=#>Tom Grennan</a> spoke to me, and revealed that their secret weapon was rapper <a href=#>Bugzy Malone</a>.</p><p>Tom said: “Bugzy is a machine, he is a big defender.”</p><p>Joel added: “He is a powerhouse. They have <a href=#>Usain Bolt</a> on the other team, so it will be a good battle. It’ll be a war.”</p><p>Little Bit Of Love singer Tom also confirmed he would be getting his guitar out for a few tunes at the after- party – once he had finished his gig in Gloucestershire.</p><p>He added: “I wasn’t at the party last night and I have a gig tonight.<br>“I will come back and play some chilled-out ones.</p><p>“There are no caners here. What happens at Soccer Aid stays at Soccer Aid.”</p><p>Let’s hope the England management team of <a href=#>Harry Redknapp</a>, <a href=#>Stormzy</a>, <a href=#>Vicky McClure</a>, <a href=#>Emma Hayes</a> and <a href=#>David Seaman</a> didn’t catch <a href=#>Danny Dyer</a> sneaking off for a cigarette during a break in training then.</p><p>Fans can watch the action on ITV tomorrow from 6.30pm.<br>Given that the World XI have won the last four clashes, I hope England can finally clinch it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/exclusive-anne-marie-takes-wild-823775547.jpg><p>YOU have to do a double take before recognising this cowgirl as she shoots a Wild West video.</p><p>But here is <a href=#>Anne-Marie</a>, who dyed her hair dark specially for the job in Kent ahead of her performance at Capital’s Summertime Ball tomorrow.</p><p>My exclusive photo shows her in tight leather trousers as temperatures soared on Thursday, while she filmed the visuals for her <a href=#>Shania Twain</a> collaboration Unhealthy.</p><p>Anne-Marie,who has been riding high in the charts with her<a href=#> David Guetta </a>collaboration Baby Don’t Hurt Me, will release her third album, also called Unhealthy, on July 28.</p><p>Then later in the year she will be heading out on the road for her own arena tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/grace-jones-attends-grace-jones-678008544.jpg><p>GRACE JONES is still living up to her reputation as the ultimate diva aged 75 – by demanding fresh oysters backstage ahead of her appearance at Cambridge Club Festival.</p><p>The <a href=#>Pull Up To The Bumper singer</a> headlined the event last night and had her rider feast prepared by local celebrity chef Tristan Welch.</p><p>As well as oysters, she was treated to scallops and sashimi – along with a quirky treat.</p><p>Tristan promised to give her one of his trademark drinks backstage at the event, which will be headlined by <a href=#>Lionel Richie </a>tonight, and said he would share a video of it on his TikTok page.</p><p>He told me: “I’ll be serving my old banana and used-coffee iced shake to give Grace a bit of boost for the show.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/www-instagram-com-zayn-689995306.jpg><p>FORMER bandmates<a href=#> Liam Payne</a> and <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a> are moving in different directions.</p><p>I can reveal Liam is <a href=#>back with US model Kate Cassidy</a> after a month’s break but his ex-<a href=#>One Direction </a>pal is single once again.</p><p>Zayn had been linked to <a href=#>Selena Gomez </a>but she has now insisted she is very much single.</p><p>Confirming the news in a <a href=#>TikTok </a>video, Selena revealed in a playful clip: “I’m single.
