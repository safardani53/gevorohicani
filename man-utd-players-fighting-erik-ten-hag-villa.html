with Garnacho's disallowed goal seemingly only further stoking their fire.</p><p>United made more tackles than the visitors as they battled to win the ball back - and, eventually, the game.</p><p><a href=#>Garnacho</a> admitted at full-time that he told the dressing room at half-time to "keep pressing" and they could get back into the game.</p><p>He told Amazon Prime: "I said in the changing room [at half-time] we just needed one goal to get back in the game so it was just: score and keep pressing.</p><p>"So I am very happy.
