The&nbsp;<i>Cobra Kai&nbsp;</i>alum was rushed to a local hospital, where he is under medical observation.</p><p class=p1>“He is currently&nbsp;in critical condition and<a href=#> it’s a wait-and-see situation</a>,” Lago told the outlet in a statement, noting his family is “aware” of his condition. “There are no future updates at this time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Saving-Private-Ryan-Actor-tom-Sizemore-Hospitalized-In-Critical-Condition-After-Brain-Aneurysm-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Pearl Harbor&nbsp;</i>actor is best known for his role as Sergeant Mike Horvath in&nbsp;<i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, which was released in 1998 and directed by <a href=#><strong>Steven Spielberg</strong></a>. Sizemore has also starred in the likes of&nbsp;<i>Black Hawk Down, Heat, Passenger 57&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Company of Heroes.&nbsp;</i>Sizemore recently played Dr. Tom for eight episodes of&nbsp;<i>Barbee Rehab</i>, which aired last year.</p><p class=p1>“<i>Natural Born Killers</i>, it was my first big lead in a movie,” he recalled during an April 2022 appearance on <a href=#>Good Day Sacramento</a>. “My first day shooting with<a href=#><strong> Tommy Lee Jones</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Oliver Stone</strong></a> came over to me and said, ‘Before we start to today, I want to let you know that I’m making a table and I got three good legs and I need another leg and you’re that leg. You’re not going to wobble are you?’”</p><p class=p1>Sizemore jokingly added: “It didn’t instill a lot of confidence me. … I said, ‘I don’t have any intention to wobble.’ That was my introduction to the uncompromising way to make movies.”</p><p class=p1>The Michigan native — who <a href=#>shares children Jagger and Jayden </a>with ex <strong>Janelle McIntire</strong> — also has a history of past drug use. Sizemore was charged with methamphetamine possession in 2007, to which he pleaded no contest.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Celebrity Rehab&nbsp;</i>alum later made headlines in November 2017, when he was<a href=#> accused of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl</a> on the set of a movie.</p><p class=p1>“I never, nor would I ever, sexually touch a child. I have done many things I’m not proud of in this life. However, I did not do this,” Sizemore <a href=#>told the&nbsp;<i>Daily Mail&nbsp;</i>in a statement at the time</a>, denying the “repulsive” claims. “These allegations are completely untrue and unfounded and I will do everything in my power to clear my name.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Relic&nbsp;</i>actor — who previously served jail time in 2003 for allegedly assaulting then-girlfriend <strong>Heidi Fleiss</strong> — was subsequently dropped by his management firm and agency following the scandal. Sizemore’s accuser filed a lawsuit, and it was dismissed in 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>If you or anyone you know is facing substance abuse issues, call the<a href=#>&nbsp;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Helpline</a>&nbsp;at 1-800-662-4357 for free and confidential information 24/7.</i></p><p class=p1><i>If you have experienced sexual assault, call the&nbsp;<a href=#>National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline</a>&nbsp;at 1-800-656-4673 for confidential support.
