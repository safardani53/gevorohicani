I was like, ‘I’m exhausted.’ I went home and got in bed.”</p><p>The NFL star insisted that he “didn’t turn it down” when asked by Kelce to meet up with Swift after the Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears. Jones claimed he was “just too tired to go,” adding, “<a href=#>Listen, I’m part Swifie</a>. I support the Swifties.”</p><p>Jones named “Karma” as his current top track from the Grammy winner, noting that he is aware that Swift recently changed the lyrics to say, “<a href=#>Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me</a>” in reference to her budding romance.</p><p>“Things are heating up between them, huh?” Jones teased. “I like it! Travis Kelce, he’s a lovable guy.”</p><p>Kelce made headlines this past summer when he revealed he was upset he missed his chance to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at her Eras Tour performance in Kansas City. Months later, Kelce revealed he invited Swift to come watch him play — an invite she accepted on September 24.</p><p>Swift has since <a href=#>been spotted at several of Kelce’s games</a> wearing red or Chiefs accessories in support of the tight end.</p><p>“Travis and Taylor are a very real couple, they actually spend a lot of one-on-one time together and have developed a very real connection,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told Us Weekly</a> earlier this month. “They have very detailed plans coming up on how to stay together while she’s on tour and he has games.”</p><p>Kelce was recently was spotted in Argentina during his team’s bye week, cheering on Swift as she kicked off her South American Eras Tour leg. During the November 11 show, she gave Kelce a shout-out during “Karma” and was later seen kissing him backstage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As things continue to heat up between the pair, an insider told Us that Swift and Kelce are ready for their parents to connect. Taylor’s mom and dad, <strong>Andrea</strong> and <strong>Scott Swift</strong>, <a href=#>“plan to meet” Travis’ parents</a>, <strong>Donna Kelce</strong> and <strong>Ed Kelce</strong>, for the first time at the Monday NFL game, the source revealed to Us on Wednesday, November 15.</p><p>The game will be a rematch from Super Bowl LVII, in which Travis’ Chiefs beat his brother, <strong>Jason Kelce</strong>, and the Eagles. Jason, 36, plays center for the Philadelphia team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJmas7R5wqGpoqtdn7yvsdJmq56Zo5rAbsDAsqOoql2oxKqy06xknpmXobK0ecaapJ5lkaW9pq3RmqWcnV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cord-mccoy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cord McCoy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-samantha-abernathy-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Samantha Abernathy Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
