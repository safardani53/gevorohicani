Fourth in this last year when possibly going for home too early. Big chance.</p><p><strong>(2) Anibale Fly 10-1</strong></p><p>Stayed on into third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup when last seen. Still looks relatively unexposed over these staying trips and shouldn't be discounted.</p><p><strong>(3) The Last Samuri 16-1</strong></p><p>Back for his third crack at the race. Second in 2016 before 16th last year. Needs more and looks to have had his chance.</p><p><strong>(4) Valseur Lido 50-1</strong></p><p>Promising smart stayer a few years ago but suffered with injuries. Doesn't look the same horse this year but would be dangerous if bouncing back.</p><p><strong>(5) Total Recall 10-1</strong></p><p>Thrived since joining Willie Mullins winning three of his four starts. Fell in the Gold Cup but his Munster National demolition job puts him right up there.</p><p><strong>(6) Alpha Des Obeaux 33-1</strong></p><p>Been running in top races and despite plenty thinking he's disappointed he may just need this drop in class. Very talented and will stay. Lively outsider for National-winning trainer Mouse.</p><p><strong>(7) Perfect Candidate 66-1</strong></p><p>Below form the last twice and was pulled up in the race last year. Oppose.</p><p><strong>(8) Shantou Flyer 33-1</strong></p><p>Been the bridesmaid recently but run in some decent handicaps. Will love it if it turns soft and is one to keep on your side if conditions are right.</p><p><strong>(9) Tenor Nivernais 150-1</strong></p><p>Beaten miles in this last year and his form so far doesn't look good enough. Outsider for a reason.</p><p><strong>(10) Carlingford Lough 50-1</strong></p><p>Not been in the best of form this season but you should never underestimate connections.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Sunracing's charity bet</h3></p><p>The Sunracing team have been busy studying the form and thanks to <strong><a href=#>OLBG</a> </strong>they have selected<strong> ALPHA DES OBEAUX</strong> as their charity bet.</p><p>We've stuck Â£25 each-way on him and any winnings will go to the Injured Jockeys Fund.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Click here</a> for all the latest news/tips and odds for the National with OLBG.</p><p><strong>(11) Tiger Roll 10-1</strong></p><p>Bounced back when winning the Cross Country last time. Will stay all day and has been well backed. One of the main contenders.</p><p><strong>(12) Regal Encore 25-1 - NON RUNNER</strong></p><p>Kept on well to win back in February at Ascot. Looked like he didn't get get home last year, others stronger.</p><p><strong>(13) Vieux Lion Rouge 33-1</strong></p><p>Seventh and sixth in the last two renewals. Wouldn't be a surprise to see him in the mix again but will most likely have to settle for a minor placing.</p><p><strong>(14) Chase The Spud 66-1</strong></p><p>Midlands National winner last year but pulled up the last twice.</p><p><strong>(15) Warriors Tale 50-1</strong></p><p>Purchased by Trevor Hemmings after his Doncaster second. Owner knows how to find a National winner. Unexposed over these trips.</p><p><strong>(16) Seeyouatmidnight 16-1</strong></p><p>Smart stayer for Sandy Thomson and will stay all day. Well fancied to be in the mix and he looks versatile ground-wise.</p><p><strong>(17) Gas Line Boy 33-1</strong></p><p>Sefton Handicap Chase winner earlier in the season, fifth in the race last year and bound to run his usual solid race. Each-way claims.</p><p><strong>(18) The Dutchman 25-1</strong></p><p>Galloped into contention when winning the Peter Marsh but was disappointing last time. Needs to bounce back.</p><p><strong>(19) Pleasant Company 40-1</strong></p><p>Ninth in this last year when he was Ruby Walsh's pick. Pulled up last time and not shown the same form.</p><p><strong>(20) Ucello Conti 20-1</strong></p><p>Unseated at Bechers second time round last year, always runs his race in these big handicaps but his one bad run came last time in January at Gowran. 3lb lower mark than last year.</p><p><strong>(21) Saint Are 50-1</strong></p><p>Has placed in three Grand Nationals, but pulled up on his last two starts. Will need to rediscover his best form but as a 12-year-old he's getting on.</p><p><strong>(22) Raz De Maree 33-1</strong></p><p>Might be a 13-year-old but was brilliant when winning the Welsh National. Unlucky when unseating here early on, if the rain continues to fall he has to be considered.</p><p><strong>(23) I Just Know 20-1</strong></p><p>Warmed up for this with a run over hurdles, previously a strong stayer when winning the North Yorkshire Grand National. Worse bets out there.</p><p><strong>(24) Virgilio 100-1</strong></p><p>Had a wind op since his last run but has to improve tons to be involved. Look elsewhere.</p><p><strong>(25) Baie Des Iles 16-1</strong></p><p>Her staying on fifth behind<strong> Native River</strong> in last year's Welsh Grand National reads well. Plenty of strong form in these races, one to be involved at a big price if she takes to the fences.</p><p><strong>(26) Maggio 100-1</strong></p><p>Bits and pieces of good form but not very consistent, not on the shortlist.</p><p><strong>(27) Pendra 80-1</strong></p><p>Goes best fresh but was disappointing at Cheltenham when last seen. 13th in this race two years ago. Vulnerable again.</p><p><strong>(28) Buywise 50-1</strong></p><p>Gained long overdue win at Sandown in January, will appreciate the return to fences after latest hurdles run but needs more.</p><p><strong>(29) Childrens List 66-1</strong></p><p>Pulled up when last seen, trainer looks to have much better chances in the race.</p><p><strong>(30) Lord Windermere 50-1</strong></p><p>Fell in the Becher when last seen. Former Gold Cup winner never really reached that level of form since. Seventh in the race last year.</p><p><strong>(31) Captain Redbeard 50-1</strong></p><p>Been in good form this season, loves heavy ground but lacks a bit of class.</p><p><strong>(32) Houblon Des Obeaux 50-1</strong></p><p>Not run up to his best form so far this year, tenth in this last year but best days are behind him.</p><p><strong>(33) Bless The Wings 50-1</strong></p><p>Struggling for form this season and was last seen being pulled up in the Irish National.</p><p><strong>(34) Milansbar 33-1</strong></p><p>Brilliant Bryony Frost is back on him which is a bonus, stays and jumps well. May lack a slight class edge but not to be underestimated.</p><p><strong>(35) Final Nudge 50-1</strong></p><p>Beaten quite a way at Cheltenham but third in the Welsh National puts him in the mix. Others stronger.</p><p><strong>(36) Double Ross 100-1</strong></p><p>Good fourth after a break at Cheltenham but pulled up on his only attempt at this race back in 2016.</p><p><strong>(37) Road To Riches 50-1</strong></p><p>Pulled up at Punchestown latest, needs the National fences to spark him back into life. Unreliable.</p><p><strong>(38) Thunder And Roses 66-1</strong></p><p>Fallen the last twice and was pulled up the time before. In no sort of form and unseated in this race last year.</p><p><strong>(39) Delusionofgrandeur 66-1&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Saves his best for Catterick, this would be a huge ask and doesn't look up to the task.</p><p><strong>(40) Walk In The Mill 66-1&nbsp; - NON RUNNER</strong></p><p>Pulled up behind fellow Aintree hope The Dutchman last time. Looks an outsider for a reason.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Shocking moment horse attempts to ESCAPE Towcester Racecourse after running in woods and knocking jockey off</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cIGYcWhwcGRktLOtzZ1kp5mknryvrctmaWlpaGK%2FtrrNnqmsZZGjsW6%2ByJ2cq6tdpbavv9OimqSdoqh6qMHInZxmmZmjwbOxxGajmqyVqMFuu8OdqmaZnpl6tbXPrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./storm-sanders-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Storm Sanders Parents Michael And Genene Sanders</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./edgar-ramirez-eating-ice-cream-favorite-scene-netflix-yes-day.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Edgar Ramrez on Eating Ice Cream in Netflix's Yes Day</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
