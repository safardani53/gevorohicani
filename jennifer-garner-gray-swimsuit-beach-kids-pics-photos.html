The actress had her long locks down and couldn’t help but smile as she took in the nice weather with her daughters, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Violet</strong></a>, 14, and<strong> Seraphina</strong>, 11, and showed off her cute one-piece, which included a pretty tied bow in the front. Violet also looked stylish in her own blue striped tank top and shorts and Seraphina wore a yellow one-piece.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jennifer-garner-grey-swimsuit-mega-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>At one point, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother and daughters</a> took a splash in the ocean and looked ecstatic to be enjoying the warm weather in Oct. Jen showed up to the beach while wearing a white and pink face mask but made sure to remove it when she was at least six feet away from others. The ladies also&nbsp; laid their towels out on the sand after arriving and didn’t try and draw attention to themselves as they took advantage of their fun family time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jennifer-garner-grey-swimsuit-mega-post-2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>This is just one of many times Jennifer and her kids, who she shares with ex <strong>Ben Affleck</strong>, 48, were spotted out and about over the past few months. On Sept. 22, the Alias star and her oldest gal were seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>walking outside</a> while holding hands and wearing face masks, and earlier this year, she was seen picking up a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>box of oranges</a> with Seraphina and her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>youngest child, <strong>Samuel</strong></a>, 8. It’s been some of the various activities the doting parent has been doing since being in quarantine with her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jennifer-garner-grey-swimsuit-mega-post-1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Although Jennifer is pretty private when it comes to sharing information about her kids, she has opened up a little about how they’re coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects and explained the benefits to having kids her age during this time in the world when speaking to <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> during an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>appearance on The Tonight Show: At Home Edition</a> in March.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I think I have the perfect age kids for this because they’re big enough to understand and to have the conversations,” she told Jimmy after he asked how her children were handling things. “Like, we’re built for challenge, we can do this, we’re a tough team. Let’s learn about a vacuum cleaner. But they’re not so big that they’re just like, ‘Well I don’t care. I’m going to go.’”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>She went on to confirm that they do have “online school” and have “engaged in different ways” by staying in touch with family members through Skype or Zoom. “I have nothing to complain or worry about,” she said while expressing her gratitude for her food and shelter. “I have nothing to complain about or worry about. It’s actually been totally fine for me. We have a job to do, we’re doing it, we’re staying home. We’re flattening that curve.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49tZqOdnqO2p7HRZp6aqp6av26z0ZqwZqunnrq0wcitZJudkZi1brfInapmqJmYwG68x6irqKtf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./monalisa-60-days-in.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>60 Days In: Monalisa Johnsons daughter has been released from jail Thu 17 September 2020 15:</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./invisalign-facts-you-need-to-know.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Invisalign Facts You Need to Know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
