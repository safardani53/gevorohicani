It was toward the end when I started saying no to things that weren’t me.</p><p>“Hair got more natural, implants came out. No more fake tan or life.”</p><p>She continued: “I was still sick physically and mentally, but on the road to recovery.”</p><p><a href=#>Crystal</a>, who previously revealed that her breast implants "slowly poisoned” her in a 2016, added: “I’m always torn when I talk about the Playboy Mansion because in a lot of ways it was a sanctuary to me, but in other ways, it was my prison.”</p><p>She then reflected on her marriage to Hugh, writing: “He was good to me in many ways, but in other ways, he wasn’t.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>“I’m still healing from certain experiences.”</p><p>Crystal concluded: “It feels very contradictory at times to reflect back.</p><p>“I really want to start opening up and being honest with you guys about it all.”</p><h2>PRAISE FOR CRYSTAL</h2><p>Shortly after Crystal shares the post, her <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers rushed to the comments section to praise her for opening up.</p><p>One person wrote: "Love your honesty."</p><p>Another added: "I’m proud of you for coming back to yourself."</p><p>A third chimed in: "Thank you for being brave and sharing your story with us. Healing can be a consistent process, I hope you’re being kind to yourself on your journey."</p><p>The former Playboy Playmate was married to <a href=#>Hugh</a> from 2012 until his death in 2017 at the age of 91.</p><h2>HEALTH PROBLEMS</h2><p>Crystal has been open in the past about how her breast implants made her sick.</p><p>After explaining that she experienced symptoms including "intolerance to foods and beverages, unexplained back pain, constant neck and shoulder pain, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog, memory loss), stunted hair growth" and more in a 2016 <a href=#>Facebook post</a>, she shared that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease.</p><p>Crystal wrote: "After I was diagnosed with Lyme disease and toxic mold, I posted about it on social media. I began to receive comments saying that my symptoms resembled 'Breast Implant Illness.'</p><p>"I found a Breast Implant Illness website and Facebook group with almost 3,000 members. My symptoms matched theirs."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The model explained that implants "break down and wreak havoc on your body. The shell on silicone and saline implants is comprised of silicone and over 40 other toxic chemicals: tin, zinc, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, formaldehyde and talc to name a few. Your immune system is constantly fighting them, leaving you vulnerable to other illnesses."</p><p>After sharing that she had her implants removed, Crystal concluded the post by encouraging her fans to let those in a similar situation "know that Implant Illness is real and could be the problem."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000697657419.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000597585609.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000629194154.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Kendra Wilkinson reveals Playboy mansion 'smelled like dog s**t and had animal feces everywhere'</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYW6Dcn6XaJ%2Bun5hitaayzZ6pZq%2BZm7Jur9Gyqq2ZnGK9ra3Ym6ayZZ2Wu7S1zqdkqaqZqLyveceemKWhnpx6rq3Rq6Can5Vk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./john-legend-video-wild-chrissy-teigen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Legends Video For Wild With Chrissy Teigen Is Steamy AF Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-a-salvi.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Patrick A.
