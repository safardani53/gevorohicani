But in all honesty,&nbsp;Costabile admitted that he had no idea how&nbsp;Paul Giamatti lost so much weight. Also, there has been no word on how much weight&nbsp;Paul Giamatti&nbsp;lost. Still, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Cinemaholic</a>&nbsp;cited a weight loss of 15 pounds.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Then, shifting the conversation, he jokingly claimed that he decided to keep his beard and put on the extra pounds that Giamatti had shredded.&nbsp;</p><h2>Paul Giamatti Had Six Months to Lose Weight</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>According to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">report from Variety</a>, Billions put the production of its fifth season on hold in April 2020. The outlet&nbsp;announced that Showtime had decided to run with whatever they had for a partial season for the time being.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The first part of season 5 premiered in May 2020 and ended in July 2020,&nbsp;after just seven episodes. The decision was obviously influenced by the global pandemic that was on the rise for the better part of 2020.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A couple of months later, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Deadline reported</a> that the show resumed production in October 2020, right around the time Showtime announced&nbsp;that they had renewed the show for a sixth season.&nbsp;</p><p>The outlet also speculated that the production of the sixth season would start immediately after the cast and crew wrapped up the remainder of the fifth season.&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, it is fair to assume that Giamatti had less than six months to make up his mind and put in the necessary effort to undergo a total revamp.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Fans Are Surprised</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Fans of the show soon got around to sharing their reactions to Giamatti's amazing weight loss <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via Reddit</a>. One user claimed that it was outright jarring to see Giamatti looking so different in the new trailer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Another fan took the time to examine the actor's appearance properly and collate their thoughts over a post that noted how he had lost weight, shaved off his&nbsp;beard after many years, lost a bit of hair from the top of his head, and comfortably wore his hair white. They added,&nbsp;</p><p>All those changes in his appearance, which almost all of us are seeing at once for the first time in over a year, make for a huge impact.</p><p>Understandably, the fans were surprised by Giamatti's transformation. However, while&nbsp;the actor's weight loss was completely unexpected for most of us, Gary Levine,&nbsp;Showtime Networks’ president of entertainment, has assured everyone that the show's narrative would not change even with the forced hiatus.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKiRqrlus8iapJqspJ56uLHIoJ%2BtZZykwLR5waKjpaGfo8BvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bj-armstrong.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bj Armstrong</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./arturo-sandoval-19491106-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Arturo Sandoval (Trumpet Player) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
