Go ahead."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Wheel of Fortune">Read more on Wheel of Fortune</h2><p>Corrine then guessed: "Peppermint - sprinkles, oil, toffee, tea."</p><p>Pat deemed it correct: "Yes, you got it - there you go."</p><p>"Anyway, you've got $1,150 dollars and I'm going to sit down and take a break," Pat said cutting to the commercial.</p><p>Corrine's score went to $1.15K and she wound up winning the episode with $26K total.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>'HOW WAS THAT ALLOWED?'</h2><p><a href=#>Wheel of Fortune</a> viewers flooded Twitter and collectively spun out, arguing that Corrine did add something to her answer despite Pat's plain instruction.</p><p>She added "Peppermint," the prompt below the board, then said for the four words actually on the board.</p><p>"Wait a min....... that counted?" one viewer tweeted at the game show in astonishment.</p><p>Another wrote: "I’m confused. The contestant said 'peppermint' before solving the puzzle and they gave her credit. With the Crossword category, you’re not supposed to add anything."</p><p>"Woah woah woah! I object," wrote a third as a fourth agreed: "Technically she added peppermint which isn’t on the board."</p><p>A fifth slammed: "My whole family and my friends are wondering why Corinne got credit for solving the crossword puzzle--where she can't add anything--and she added the word Peppermint!"</p><p>"The word 'peppermint' wasn't in the puzzle! It was the clue! Maggie [Sajak] can you explain this?"</p><p>A sixth agreed: "Wheel of Fortune, How come the lady won the money tonight when she said peppermint when she said the words to the crossword?"</p><p>While a seventh rang in: "Whoa Wheel of Fortune Changed the rules again?!?&nbsp; She added Peppermint to her answer.&nbsp;You guys need to give up the crossword for real."</p><p>One more of dozens asked: "I’m confused as to how that’s okay?&nbsp;I get that it's in the title but you’re so strict with the 'and' and you always say don’t add anything …. Soooooo????"</p><p>"I think Pat hesitated if they can accept that or not," yet one more couldn't ignore as someone replied to them: "They’re so strict about adding anything! I’m surprised he let this go."</p><h2>UNSOLVED</h2><p>Earlier this fall, the show presented a puzzle that&nbsp;<a href=#>appeared to have racist roots</a>, as it was tied to a nursery rhyme originally from the slavery era.</p><p>During&nbsp;<a href=#>another episode</a>&nbsp;of the show,&nbsp;<a href=#>Vanna White</a>, 65,&nbsp;awkwardly smiled as she stood by a puzzle that read: "Warm, Wet and Wild."</p><p>"Ew," one fan tweeted sharing the unfortunate image.&nbsp;</p><p>"???" tweeted another sharing the same NSFW screenshot.</p><h2>'DEPRESSING TO THINK ABOUT'</h2><p>Pat's 40-year partner in letter plucking,&nbsp;Vanna revealed her thoughts on being replaced to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> - and she isn't planning on it.</p><p>"I think when Merv Griffin chose both of us, 40 and 41 years ago, he saw something between us — a brother-sister type relationship.</p><p>"And I think that is kind of what it is. He saw that we would be able to get along, and we do. We are like a brother and sister team."</p><p>On retirement, she added: "I don't even want to think about that. I mean, we're a team.</p><p>That's depressing. I don't even want to think about it."</p><p>"I just visualize us just being there. I can't think beyond that."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I can't imagine.
