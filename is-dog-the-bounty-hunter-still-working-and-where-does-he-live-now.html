Duane Lee Chapman is now known for sharing his adventures on <a href=#>Dog The Bounty Hunter</a> on A&E from 2004 to 2012.</p><p>The reality star came to international notice as a <a href=#>bounty hunter for his successful capture of&nbsp;Max Factor&nbsp;heir</a>&nbsp;Andrew Luster&nbsp;in Mexico in 2003.

But Dog is continuing the job without him, and regularly posts updates about his hunting adventures on Instagram.</p><p>Duane recently found another son of his, called John Chapman. He received a call, as revealed on his recent church The Source Church speech, that he is the father of a grown boy who was adopted.</p><p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Access</a>&nbsp;on his Masked Singer appearance, Dog said he “tries to be a good Christian person, always.” Now 57, Duane puts his all into bringing faith into others’ lives alongside bounty hunting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-does-dog-the-bounty-hunter-live>Where does Dog The Bounty Hunter live?</h2><p>Dog currently lives in Naples. However, he isn’t always at home as he travels the USA and more recently, said he was heading to Utah where the murders of Crystal Turner and Kylen Schulte remain unsolved.</p><p>He was originally born in Denver, Colorado, one of the places where Dog, who opposes bail reform, has joined movements – as well as California, Vermont, and New Jersey – that seek to oppose or overturn bail reform laws.</p><p>Colorado is also where Duane and his wife tied the knot in 2021. Previously, Duane lived in the east Honolulu suburb of Hawaii Kai with his late wife Beth, where they had gotten married.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Duane Lee Chapman (@duanedogchapman)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-now-travels-with-wife-francie>He now travels with wife Francie</h2><p>Duane, who got remarried to Colorado rancher Francie Frane in September 2021, is now travelling the USA with his wife.
