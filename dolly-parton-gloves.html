She's the undisputed Queen of Country who uses her popularity and platform to perform delightful music and to give free books to children.</p><p>In 2021, she even won her very first Emmy Award for her Netflix Christmas special, Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square, at the age of 75.</p><p>Oh, and she also donated $1 million to Moderna to fund research for the COVID-19 vaccine. What's not to like?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another thing we love about <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> is her inimitable style. Not just anyone could pull off wearing all those rhinestones, but for Dolly? They just make sense.</p><p>But there's another facet of Dolly Parton's style that we're curious about. Why does Dolly Parton often wear skin-toned, fingerless gloves? Here's what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why does Dolly Parton wear gloves?</h2><p>You may not have even realized that Dolly Parton is almost always wearing gloves. Sometimes her outfits feature fingerless gloves that are fully visible, but other times, it seems like she wears skin-colored gloves that you might miss at first glance. The fact that her gloves are sometimes just barely visible leads most people to believe that the gloves are more than just a style choice.</p><p>First of all, though, we should get this out of the way: Dolly Parton might just wear gloves because she likes wearing gloves. She really doesn't need more reason than that. She's Dolly Parton. She can do pretty much whatever she wants to. And she always pulls it off.</p><p>The singer has also never publicly commented on the gloves, but there are a few theories about the style choice.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dolly Parton’s gloves may be hiding some scars.</h2><p>In addition to the gloves, <a href=#><u>Dolly also always wears long sleeves</u></a>. The long sleeves have sparked plenty of rumors that Dolly has tons of tattoos, but as it turns out, things go a little bit deeper than that. Dolly does have tattoos, but as she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vanity Fair</u></a>, "I'm not trying to make some big, bold statement." Instead, the tattoos are there to cover scars on the country star’s arms.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I have a tendency to have keloid scar tissue, and I have a tendency where, if I have any kind of scars anywhere, then they kind of have a purple tinge that I can never get rid of," Dolly said. "So [my tattoos] are all pastels, what few that I have, and they're meant to cover some scars."</p><p>So, do Dolly Parton’s gloves also cover some scars? They might! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dollymania.net</u></a> is a Dolly Parton fansite that’s been operated by superfan Duane Gordon since 1996. One section of the site is dedicated to "Letters to the Webmaster," where people can send in their questions about Dolly, and Duane will answer them to the best of his ability.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 2011, someone asked Duane about Dolly's gloves. Here is his response:</p><p>"For about the past nine months, Dolly has worn gloves with the fingers cut out of them at virtually every public appearance or photoshoot or video shoot, and the few times she has not had them on, she has instead worn sleeves that have additional fabric at the end so that they cover her wrists and upper parts of her hands. She has not publicly given her real reason for wearing them. Consequently, although many fans have asked me about them, I can't give an answer with first-hand information."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"However, I can relay third-hand information that she was asked about the gloves by fans while filming scenes for Joyful Noise [in 2011]," Duane continued. "[She] told them that last year [2010] she had had corrective hand surgery (medical, not cosmetic) and it left a scar that she's covering. Again, I've not heard that directly from Dolly or her management, but I'm told that's the answer she gave privately in Atlanta to those who asked."</p><p>Given what we know of Dolly's tendency to scar, we think it’s probably a pretty safe bet that Dolly Parton’s gloves are there to cover some scarring. One thing we know for sure, though, is that no matter what Dolly Parton is wearing, she always looks fabulous.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbytuNhmp5qqpKS7brPLqK2eqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hailey-bieber-is-glowing-in-baggy-clothes-rekindling-pregnancy-rumors.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hailey Bieber is GLOWING in Baggy Clothes, Rekindling Pregnancy Rumors</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-melissa-molinaro-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Melissa Molinaro Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
