If I did it now, they'd probably only allow a Shetland Pony.</p><p>“It was the idea of a former <a href=#>Sky</a> Sports floor manager.

Hence I walked in front of it.</p><p>“Barry Hearn once told me he was watching TV and saw this spectacle and decided ‘maybe I should take up darts’ – so perhaps I had something to do with the sport’s growth.”</p><p>There is, of course, far more to his <span id=c6ee9ff1-3748-4c24-b46c-b96c1e89673f class=suggested-link>sporting</span> and professional life than <strong>THAT</strong> horse.</p><p>Anderson was a decent javelin thrower growing up and targeted a spot for <a href=#>Team GB</a> at the 1968 <span id=2a65c3ec-c5c4-4214-a649-e7f013084dba class=suggested-link>Mexico</span> City Olympics until he broke a bone in his arm – which meant he focused on little arrows instead.</p><p>Part-time <span id=24671b28-a9f1-4639-94d3-a0934f2f5cf1 class=suggested-link>football</span> with Lincoln United, Woking FC and Farnborough Town kept him fit as he worked in the Civil Service in the Swindon area.</p><p>Anderson says he proudly “played his part” in the foundation of the breakaway World Darts Council – which latterly began the PDC – in the acrimonious 1990s split from the BDO.</p><p>His crowning glory came in 1988 when he beat John “Old Stoneface” Lowe 6-4 in the Lakeside final to become world champion.</p><p>Anderson, whose walk-on music is the ‘Rhinestone Cowboy’, said: “That was life-changing.
