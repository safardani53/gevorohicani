The Super Bowl champ was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2011 and has played 12 seasons with the team. He is affectionally known city-wide (and beyond!) as the "King of Philly."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kylie, however, was raised in Eagles country. Born <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>in 1992</a>, she grew up in Narberth, a Main Line suburb of Philadelphia. She stayed nearby for college, attending Cabrini University in Wayne, Pennsylvania.

"None of his pictures showed Eagles football," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kylie said that for their first date, she went to meet Jason and his friends at a bar.
