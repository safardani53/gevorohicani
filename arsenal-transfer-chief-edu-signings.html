Incredibly, £355million has been spent since he began his role.</p><p>The Brazilian, an Invincible nonetheless, is under pressure after the dismal start to the campaign, and <a href=#>latest reports have linked Dutch legend Marc Overmars to the technical director role.</a></p><p>But <a href=#>has Edu done that bad a job?</a> Judge for yourself from all the deals he's brought in, players let go, as well as the contract renewals he's signed off on.</p><h2>THE SUCCESSES</h2><p><strong>Kieran Tierney</strong></p><p>An Arsenal captain in the making, Scotland international Tierney has been Edu's standout acquisition since his £25million move from Celtic, and <a href=#>was worth of his pay rise in the summer.</a></p><p>Although he's suffered with injuries, he has quickly become a fans' favourite thanks to his swashbuckling runs down the left-flank.</p><p>His crossing ability is as good as anyone in the Premier League, but with Arsenal lacking a real centre forward many are wasted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/f394e732-cd0f-430a-8862-a10a67141c3c.jpg><p><strong>Gabriel Martinelli</strong></p><p>A fellow Brazilian, Edu brought Martinelli with him to the Emirates in the summer of 2019.</p><p>He would've been fully aware of his potential, commissioning the £6million signing from lowly Ituano for £6million, after working as Brazil's general coordinator before taking the Arsenal post.</p><p>An exciting talent, the forward was called a "talent of the century" by Jurgen Klopp and lauded by Ronaldinho.</p><p><strong>Martin Odegaard</strong></p><p>Odegaard was manager Mikel Arteta's chief target this summer after starring on loan last term, and Edu delivered the Norwegian playmaker in a £30million deal.</p><p>His ability is unquestionable, and he could be the man to provide some spark and creativity to Arsenal's misfiring forward line.</p><p>And at just 22, the midfielder <a href=#>could become a legend in North London.</a></p><h2>THE AVERAGE</h2><p><strong>Cedric Soares</strong></p><p>Brought in for free after a loan from Southampton, there was nothing wrong with signing the Portugal international.</p><p>A steady squad player, he wasn't meant to be a regular first team starter and was there to offer back-up.</p><p>However, with Hector Bellerin flirting with a move away, Callum Chambers inconsistent, the right-back might be called upon more regularly this season.</p><p><strong>Thomas Partey</strong></p><p>A blockbuster signing when he arrived on our shores, Partey was a star man in midfield for Atletico Madrid under Diego Simeone in a more rigid system.</p><p>At times he's struggled to get up to the pace of the game, taking more time on the ball than necessary.</p><p>But his class is there for all to see.

Could they promise Martinez more game-time with the German No1 back the following season?</p><p>They chose Leno, who in fairness hasn't done much wrong in North London. But that prompted the No2 to secure first team football elsewhere at Aston Villa, who signed him for £20million.</p><p>Martinez was a star of Villa's campaign last season, with some fans frustrated they let the stopper leave.</p><p>What, perhaps, makes it worse is that Arsenal struggled to replace Martinez - first trying Runarsson, then having to turn to Mat Ryan.</p><p>Now, it's Aaron Ramsdale who has the opportunity - but he did cost £4million more than Martinez.</p><p><strong>Mesut Ozil</strong></p><p>Perhaps there's some sympathy to be had for Mesut Ozil.</p><p>When Arsenal were crying out for creativity, he was frozen out - seemingly because of his £350,000-per-week pay packet and Edu and the board desperate to get his wages off their wage bill.</p><p>Eventually, he was moved on to Fenerbahce in January when his contract was cancelled.</p><p>On leaving, Ozil did have nice things to say about Edu.</p><p>"I'd like to thank Edu Gaspar for helping bring about a professional and dignified solution in the past few days," he revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000632330937.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>Odegaard was brought in as a replacement, of course, but very few players can match Ozil's vision in world football.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>It was just a shame his work rate wasn't enough for boss Arteta, but there's definitely a debate to be had that the World Cup winner could've offered something.</p><p>But the question remains; will these decisions cost Edu his job?</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Mikel Arteta tells Arsenal’s senior stars to step up and drag Gunners out of crisis after worst start to a season ever</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH52hZVpbHFuX5a%2FtLHNmqNmrKKWu7SyxKtknKCZmrNuscOuZKyhl6O2r7PSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elise-testone-showers-american-idol-with-whole-lotta-love.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elise Testone Showers American Idol with &amp;quot;Whole Lotta Love&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1388144199.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Watch Melrose Place (Classic) Season 5 Episode 32: Who's Afraid of Amanda Woodward</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
