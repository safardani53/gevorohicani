He had no hair because of his illness and treatment and Tristan wanted to show him that he looked the same as him and so he could fit in.</p><p>“Another time Tristan had a yellow Mohawk to support Kas. My son loved yellow, it’s a bright, happy colour.”</p><p>Kay said she had been left shocked when she found out about the boys' deaths and Sarah's arrest.</p><p>After news broke in the community, she took to social media, saying: “Ok here’s a long shot instead of spreading rumours and negativity let’s spread this light of love for the family of shire green and all affected”.</p><p>She included a photograph of candles set in a love heart shape.<br></p><h2>A COMMUNITY IN MOURNING</h2><p>Kay’s son Kasabian had been inundated with support during his fight against the disease, including from young Tristan.</p><p>Kasabian had been diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma and gone through more than 100 radiation treatments in his battle against cancer.</p><p>In December 2016, his family announced he had “passed peacefully in his sleep” - just five days before his ninth birthday.</p><p>And as a show of support for the sick student, Tristan dyed his own hair yellow, telling BBC show Our School: “My friend is dying of bone cancer, I asked if I could dye my hair yellow for him.</p><p>“His favourite colour is yellow.”</p><p>He added that his hair “makes me who I want to be. With normal hair, you look like any other person”.</p><p>The TV series followed teachers and pupils as they prepared to make the jump from Year 6 to Year 7.</p><h2>MUM IN COURT</h2><p>Mum Sarah Barrass, 34, is expected to go on trial later this year accused of killing her two teen sons.</p><p>Her half-brother Brandon Machin, 38, has also been accused of murdering his nephews.</p><p>Both were remanded in custody at Sheffield Crown Court over the tragedy. Police were scrambled to the home in the Shiregreen area of the city over concerns for the occupants’ welfare about 7.30am on Friday.</p><p>Horrified neighbours told how one boy was taken away on a stretcher as paramedics frantically tried to resuscitate him.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>The cause of death was not released.</p><p>The accused pair were remanded in custody at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday.</p><p>The trial is expected to be held in November this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-14.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tristan.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000492600936-e1559058461387.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tristan3-e1559056329739.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493278362.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493424242-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000492600934.jpg><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
