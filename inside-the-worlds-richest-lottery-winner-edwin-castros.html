payments.</p><p>His winnings instantly netted him a <a href=#>net worth</a> higher than celebrities such as&nbsp;<a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Madonna</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>.</p><p>However, life wasn't always as glamorous as it has been since he turned over his winning ticket.</p><p>The 30-year-old lived in a run-down one-bedroom home in Altadena, growing up in a "wholesome family" that frequently took fishing trips, sources told <a aria-label="TMZ (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Edwin Castro">Read more on Edwin Castro</h2><p>As a child, he was a member of the Eagle Boy Scouts, attending Crescenta Valley High School in La Crescenta, a short hop away from the petrol station where he bought his life-changing ticket.</p><p>Described as a "quiet guy with a kind heart," Castro studied architecture at Woodbury University in Burbank.</p><h2>BIG BUCKS</h2><p>But since striking it rich, the lucky former boy scout has wasted no time indulging in his earnings.</p><p>In the months since claiming his prize, Castro became the new owner of a <a href=#>vintage Porsche 911</a> couple, dropping $250,000 on the vehicle to cruise around California in style.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>The classic white-colored convertible came into production in 1964, featuring a roaring engine that reaches a top speed of 130mph.</p><p>In February, the 30-year-old splurged <a href=#>$25.5million on a lavish Hollywood Hills estate</a>, which includes a game room, wine cellar, gym, infinity pool, spa, a built-in barbecue area, and a stunning view of downtown <a href=#>Los Angeles</a>.</p><p>Castro's new 13,500 square-foot sprawling mansion features five bedrooms and seven bathrooms with 13,500 square feet of living space.</p><p>Less than a month later, he purchased a second $4million property on another bachelor pad in his hometown of Altadena, according to <a href=#>Dirt.com</a>.</p><p>Newly minted Castro's privacy is protected by olive trees, and he enjoys a stunning unobstructed view of the San Gabriel Mountains.</p><p>The Japanese-inspired five-bedroom, four-bath house features high ceilings and white walls.</p><h2>24/7 SECURITY</h2><p>His new lifestyle also requires 24/7 security.</p><p>Castro, who has stayed away from the limelight and is rarely seen in public, is reported to have hired three bodyguards who look after him and his property round the clock, according to the <a href=# aria-label="New York Post (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a>.</p><p>Despite keeping a relatively low profile, <a href=#>he was recently spotted grinning from ear to ear as he exited a bank with a thick envelope</a>.</p><p>In exclusive photos obtained by The U.S. Sun, Castro was spotted meeting Hollywood&nbsp;<a href=#>interior design</a>&nbsp;specialist Marina Darselia outside the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood last week as he prepared to decorate his new abode.</p><p>Despite opting for a lump-sum payment of $997.6 million after taxes following his big win in November,&nbsp;<a href=#>Castro</a>&nbsp;was not decked out in designer clothing for his shopping spree.</p><p>Instead, he opted to dress casually in baggy black sweatpants, open-toe flip-flops, and a black short-sleeved T-shirt with the yellow branding "Gas&nbsp;Monkey Garage," a popular car show.</p><p>After arriving at the location<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in a chauffeur-driven black SUV, he greeted the interior designer, and the pair headed inside for around an hour.</p><p>In a series of snaps, Castro can be seen trying out a billiards table and joking around playing shuffleboard as he chatted away with the sales staff at the 11 Ravens Billiards supply store.</p><p>It is unknown whether he ordered any high-end tables from the shop, but he was seen standing by as an assistant imputed details into her computer during a lengthy conversation.</p><p>Castro wore his waist-length dark&nbsp;hair&nbsp;pulled back in a low ponytail and was seen in one photograph leaning over a table as he tested it out and took a shot with a cue.</p><p>Since his massive win, Edwin has not done any interviews - but did give a statement via Powerball.</p><p>"As much as I am shocked and ecstatic to have won the Powerball drawing, the real winner is the California public school system," he said.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"The mission of the California Lottery, which is to provide supplemental funding for California public education - both public schools and colleges - makes this a huge win for the state.</p><p>"As someone who received the rewards of being educated in the California public education system, it's gratifying to hear that, as a result of my win, the California school system greatly benefits as well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
