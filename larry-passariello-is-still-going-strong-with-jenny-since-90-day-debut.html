Now that they’ve returned to the show’s 90 Day Diaries series to share an update, fans are wondering where they’ve been.</strong></p><p>The couple quickly became a fan favorite who viewers rooted for from the start. Larry, from the United States, flew to the <a href=#>Philippines</a> to meet his online love interest, but had to wait a year for Jenny’s K-1 visa to be approved.</p><p>Larry and Jenny hit it off immediately, and were ready to tie the knot as soon as they laid eyes on each other. Ever since, the duo have kept their relationship alive and recently returned to TLC – a comeback welcomed by fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-larry-and-jenny-s-journey>Larry and Jenny’s journey</h2><p>Larry, 37, was so devoted to Jenny, then 24, that he cashed in his 401K pension to visit her in the Philippines. And it was all worth it, including quitting his job at McDonald’s, as the couple have remained strong ever since that first meeting!</p><p>Although he was worried she was communicating with other men in America, he proposed to her at the end of season 1 of&nbsp;<a href=#>90 Day Fiance</a>: Before the 90 Days. By June 2018, Larry said he was expecting Jenny to come to the United States.</p><p>As seen on 90 Day Fiancé: What Now?, Larry and Jenny got married after her visa was approved in September 2018. They wed at the trailer park where they lived in Florida, during a ceremony attend by Larry’s parents and younger son.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don't remember Larry and Jenny very well. <a href=#>#90DayFiance</a> <a href=#>#90daydiaries</a></p>— Dave (@DaveFlame45) <a href=#>June 21, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-the-90-day-fiance-couple-are-now>Where the 90 Day Fiance couple are now</h2><p>During their <a href=#>90 Day</a> appearance, Larry explained that he was still going to&nbsp;work&nbsp;full-time every&nbsp;day&nbsp;and going on 14 years working as a maintenance man at a restaurant. By November 2018, he revealed he was quitting his job.</p><p>After they were told they could not return to the trailer park they lived at, Jenny and Larry are now renting a house in Texas for $1,300 a month. Jenny also plans to start cleaning for AirBnb when she gets her license.</p><p>Larry also revealed on their YouTube channel that he is working for his son’s business. The pair also offer&nbsp;personalized shout-outs to fans on social media, and have recently appeared on 90 Day Diaries to share an update with them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Glad to see Larry and Jenny again.

They document the latest updates on their relationship and lives but haven’t shared a video for seven months.</p><p>Their last video was called ‘In one week, everything changed’. It detailed how they were told they could not return to the trailer park – where they have lived together since Jenny’s K-1 visa was approved.</p><p>On their channel, Jenny and Larry often share insights into their date days and nights, including visiting the best fast food restaurant in the USA and taking part in one of the most unique sports ever, Jai-Alai.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH 90 DAY DIARIES ON TLC EVERY MONDAY AT 9/8C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqbmke5hpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxopJGnv7p5z5qqrJminrKtuM5moKxlo6m2rbiMoKaippdiwLW%2BzqeeZq%2BZqbVutsSnpbJlo567pLGMcmdmnJGueqWxwa6r</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./caleb-williams-responds-to-allegations-that-he-framed-josh-duggar.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Caleb Williams Responds to Allegations He Framed Josh Duggar: He's a Lying Loser!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bess-byers-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Bess Byers Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
