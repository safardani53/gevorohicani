The late 28-year-old celebrity grew up in a traveler community. He claimed on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK that his career is not acceptable in his community and that he has kept his traveling history hidden from the LGBTQIA+ community.&nbsp;George Ward became a mental health nurse in 2015 and, three years later, a drag performer known as Cherry Valentine. He also worked at a Covid vaccination facility during the coronavirus outbreak. He was chosen as a participant in the second season of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK in December 2020, which launched his television career.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Cherry-Valentine-1.jpg alt="Cherry Valentine" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He described his Valentine alter-ego as “gothic” and “glamorous,” and said that working as a nurse helped him better understand people.</p><p>“As a drag queen, you have to work with people.” And I believe you go above and beyond to understand individuals.”</p><p>Valentine starred in the BBC documentary Cherry Valentine: Gypsy Queen and Proud, which aired in January 2022.
