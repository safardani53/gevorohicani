The movie was released 10 years ago on Jan. 7, 2011, and still resonates with fans today. No one can forget when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow’s</strong></a> Kelly Canter belts out “Coming Home” to a packed house.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Gwyneth really showed off her vocal chops in Country Strong, as did <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Leighton Meester</strong></a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Garrett Hedlund</strong></a>. The soundtrack remains one of the best parts of this film. Country music icon <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tim McGraw</strong></a> took a very dramatic turn as Kelly’s focused husband and didn’t take the stage in the movie. The cast has been&nbsp;very busy over the last decade. Let’s break down where they are now!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Country-Strong-then-and-now-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong>, 48, played country singer Kelly Canter in Country Strong. At the time, Gwyneth had already won an Oscar and was one of Hollywood’s most in-demand actresses. She was already playing Pepper Potts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and continued to appear in several MCU films, her latest being <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Avengers: Endgame</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The actress won an Emmy in 2011 for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for playing Holly Holiday in Glee. Her latest projects include starring in the Netflix series The Politician and her docuseries The Goop Lab. Gwyneth <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>founded Goop</a>, a&nbsp;wellness&nbsp;and&nbsp;lifestyle brand, in 2008.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Gwyneth and then-husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chris Martin</strong></a>, 43, separated in 2014 after 10 years of marriage. They called it a “conscious uncoupling.” Their divorce was finalized in 2016. They have two kids: <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Apple</strong></a>, 16, and <strong>Moses</strong>, 14. Gwyneth married Glee and American Horror Story co-creator<strong> Brad Falchuk</strong>, 49, in 2018.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong><strong>Tim McGraw</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Country-Strong-then-and-now-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tim McGraw</strong></a>, 53,&nbsp;played James Canter, Kelly’s husband and her manager. Country Strong was right up Tim’s alley, given that he’s one of the most popular country artists of all-time. But the thing is, Tim actually didn’t even sing at all in the film. But he did release the song “Me and Tennessee” with Gwyneth as part of the movie’s soundtrack.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Country Strong was released a year after Tim starred in The Blind Side, which earned <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></a>, 56, her first Oscar. Tim went on to star in Tomorrowland in 2015 and The Shack in 2016. He served as a key advisor during The Voice season 11.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In the years since his last film role, Tim has refocused on his music career.&nbsp;He released his 16th studio album, Here on Earth, in Aug. 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Tim has been happily married to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Faith Hill</strong></a>, 53, since 1996.

The couple has three daughters: <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gracie</strong></a>, 23, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Maggie</strong></a>, 22, and <strong>Audrey</strong>, 19.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><strong><strong>Leighton Meester</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Country-Strong-then-and-now-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>Leighton Meester</strong>, 34, starred as Chiles Stanton, an up and coming singer who goes on the road with Kelly, Beau, and James. Over the course of the movie, Chiles showed she was more than just a stiff beauty queen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>At the time of Country Strong’s release, Leighton was in the midst of playing Blair Waldorf on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Gossip Girl</a>. The actress continued to play Blair through the show’s final season. After Country Strong’s release, Leighton also starred in films like The Roommate, Monte Carlo, and more.&nbsp;She released her debut album, Heartstrings, in 2014.

Beau was Kelly’s sponsor, but he also had an affair with her. Over the course of the film, he falls for Chiles and the two end up together. Garrett showed off his amazing vocals in the film.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Garrett was already a rising star in Hollywood and that continued after the release of Country Strong. He notably starred in films like On The Road, Inside Llewyn Davis, Unbroken, Mudbound, and Triple Frontier. He also starred in the HBO series Mosaic in 2017. Garrett’s next major role is in the 2021 film&nbsp;<i>The United States Vs.
