For someone who&nbsp;has been in the music scene since his teenage years when he traveled in crowded vans that often lead to empty rooms, Antonoff has come a long way.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Like many others in the industry, Jack started<span> in the indie scene with his band </span>Steel Train<span>. But, a</span>&nbsp;lot has changed since then. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In recent years, this producer-songwriter, known for his chronicles of multitasking, is busy&nbsp;lending pieces of his musical mind to artists like Taylor&nbsp;Swift, Lorde, Pink, Lana Del Rey, and even St. Vincent. His success in the music industry&nbsp;hasn't just helped him climb the success ladder; it has also aided his net worth to soar to millions.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jack Antonoff's&nbsp;Net Worth is Estimated&nbsp;to be Around&nbsp;$25 Million</h2><p>Celebrity Net Worth&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">estimates</a>&nbsp;the American musician's net worth to be around twenty-five million dollars. But how did he get there? It's simple. With his extraordinary musical talent.&nbsp;A highly successful producer, Jack's rise in the music industry began as a lead guitarist of rock band Fun., which took him on a roller coaster ride through mainstream music,&nbsp;winning Best New Artist and Song Of The Year for their song "We Are Young" in The&nbsp;Grammy Awards&nbsp;in 2013. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Along with the awards,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the song</a>, released just before the holidays, now boasts over eight hundred million views on YouTube.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, Jack's reaction to the success of the pop hit was unexpected. As <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by The New York Times, Jack did not want to be defined by a track that he could not play in his mid-thirties.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"I remember immediately —&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;— feeling like, ‘I don’t want to play “We Are Young” when I’m 35.' I don’t want to be defined by this"</p><h2>Jack always Wanted his Music to be a Part of Him</h2><p>For a musical genius that he is, Jack has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that his aversion has nothing to do with success. Instead, he felt like Fun. was something he was a part of, but he wanted his music to be a part of him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Sticking to the idea of borderline self-sabotage, Fun. did not release any more music, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the group disbanded</a>. This lead to Jack putting his heart and soul into a band named Bleachers,&nbsp;which has not achieved the same level of recognition as Fun. but&nbsp;has been central to his life ever since.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In 2014, right around the Bleachers' debut album Strange Desire hit the shelves, Jack also lent his hands to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">produce</a>&nbsp;a few critical tracks for Talyor Swift on her 2014 pop turn,&nbsp;1989. He&nbsp;was credited for songs like&nbsp;Out of the Woods,&nbsp;I Wish You Would,&nbsp;and the bonus track New Romantics. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Taylor Swift was the First Person to Recognize Him as a Producer</h2><p>Following the success of Taylor Swift's&nbsp;album, Jack's demand in the pop world increased by two folds. However, for the humble person that he is, he always <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">credits Taylor for recognizing his as a producer</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>"Taylor’s the first person who let me produce a song.&nbsp;Before Taylor, everyone said: ‘You’re not a producer.’ It took Taylor Swift to say: ‘I like the way this sounds..”</p><p>Known for his ability to draw out an artist's personality and present it in the form of music, Jack got all the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">approval</a> he needed from the pop music industry.&nbsp;His producing career skyrocketed with songs with an assortment of musicians ranging from Sia to Fifth Harmony.</p><p>Ever since 2017, one&nbsp;couldn't avoid his music if they&nbsp;tried because&nbsp;he was the force behind some of the year's highly&nbsp;debated and chart-hitting singles. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Although Jack would have made it big as a performer, the multitasker in him took him to find success as a producer.&nbsp;For someone who considers music production as "holding the song in a right way", Jack <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">encourages</a>&nbsp;the artists he collaborates with&nbsp;to express themselves as they would to a friend. This has&nbsp;made him one of the most in-demand&nbsp;producers in pop culture. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BupLeMmqWtp56ks6d5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpesetpKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./allison-dubois-reflects-on-rhobh-episode-amid-kyle-and-mauricio-split.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Allison DuBois Reflects on RHOBH Episode Amid Kyle and Mauricio Split</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vanderpump-rules-stars-take-girls-trip-to-paris-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vanderpump Rules Stars Take Girls Trip to Paris: Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
