I did white elephant this year. Went to a party and we did white elephant and I went first and I picked my gift and it was a 25 dollar Visa gift card. It was so cool. 25 dollars thanks, I love 25 dollars. And then we get to like the fourth or fifth person and um, someone, someone stole, someone stole my gift. And so I had to pick another gift, and I picked this bag," Brionna says, laughing into the camera.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@wunderbri href=#>@wunderbri</a><p>White Elephant takes another victim <a title=whiteelephant href=#>#whiteelephant</a> <a title=whiteelephantgonewrong href=#>#whiteelephantgonewrong</a> <a title=christmas2023 href=#>#christmas2023</a> <a title=merrycrisis href=#>#merrycrisis</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Brionna" href=#>♬ original sound - Brionna</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @wunderbri</span></figure><p>"And it said fragile on it and said 'do not shake' and I'm like 'oooh' this is gonna be something interesting. I like bags that come with instructions so I picked that bag. I picked that bag and I opened the bag and inside of the bag there's a bowl and inside of the bowl there's a cup, and before I tell you what's in this cup I just I wanna I wanna ask what kind of monster would do this. What, what, what goes through a person's mind when they decide this is, this is a thing that I...don't know know who's gonna get this," she concedes.</p><p>"This is the thing that I think that I'm fine with anybody getting." She then reaches off-camera to grab a fish bowl, which shows a singular, colorful Beta fish swimming around in it. She slams it down on the table and the fish appears to be startled, "I'm so sorry," she tells the animal.</p><p>"What?" she implores into the camera. "What?" again. "Anyway, so let me tell you the origin of the term white elephant, which I just learned. So appropriate, was that the kings in Siam used to give white elephants as a gift to people they did not like."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @wunderbri</span></figure><p>Why wouldn't anyone want an elephant as a pet? Well, she explained why: the recipients of the gift were effectively being handed a burden they would then have to care for: "Because the upkeep of the elephant would, would ruin them financially."</p><p>It seems that Brionna feels there is a distinct correlation between the origin of the holiday "White Elephant" game and the fish that she received as part of the exchange.</p><p>"So all I was given for this living creature is a bowl and a little teeny tiny packet of food, just little pellets, just little pellets for a living, you've given me a living, you've given me a mouth to feed. So I just had to go spend my own money to, to get a tank, cause I can't, it doesn't even have a top on it, I have cats," she says, explaining that the fish bowl isn't going to be a suitable habitat for the beta fish.</p><p>She says she needed to buy a "tank and some rocks...and some little flaky food for him. And a little water filter cause it's already starting to get muggy in here."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @wunderbri</span></figure><p>Brionna just couldn't believe that someone would think it'd be a good idea to gift someone a fish as part of a White Elephant gift exchange: "Who does this? Like thank God he came home with me. I have some value for his poor little fishy life. What if he ended up with someone who just flushed him down the toilet? You don't know!"</p><p>She looks at the fish again before asking again: "What kind of a monster?" and then the clip ultimately cuts out. Numerous TikTokers seemed to agree with Brionna's outrage and thought that gifting a Betta fish was a really bad idea.</p><p>"A mouth to feed… in this economy?!?!" one person wrote. Another suggested that if she wants to care for the little guy, she could hop onto a community forum and learn the ways of Betta care: "i did not watch the whole video omg PLEASE go to the betta fish subreddit for betta care! they are so incredibly helpful! you will fall in love-"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @wunderbri</span></figure><p>It turns out Brionna wasn't the only person to get a living, swimming fish as a White Elephant gift, however: "My husband got a fish for white elephant right before we got married. We had him for 3 years haha. RIP Macrelmore"</p><p>Someone else penned: "The fact that I’ve been to more then one party where the favors were pets… totally insane."</p><p>And a person who works for a popular pet store chain said that they've come across a lot of folks who thought gifting fish would be a great idea as well: "The fact that I’ve been to more then one party where the favors were pets… totally insane."</p><p>The financial burden of being handled a fish was a problem another TikTok user who responded to Brionna's post said that they were also forced to endure: "I knew it as soon as you said bowl. My daughter got one last year too. $10 limit. We spent $200 on supplies," they said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mqZ6blZ7Dpr%2BMn6CsoF2starAxGacpZ2gna6vwIygoJ%2Bs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aline-bernardes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aline Bernardes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ricky-irelands-girlfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ricky Ireland Dating Ricky Ireland's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
