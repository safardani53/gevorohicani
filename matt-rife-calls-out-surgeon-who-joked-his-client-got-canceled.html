Fans were quick to share their thoughts in the comments section.</p><p>“Revealing yourself under your surgeon’s vague post is insane,” one follower wrote while another added, “he just outed himself in the comments.” A third social media user commented, “As your profile says… ‘Stop taking the internet so seriously.’”</p><p>In July, Rife denied plastic surgery rumors while boxing with <strong>Mario Lopez</strong> for an Access Hollywood <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube video</a>.</p><p>In the clip, Lopez, 50, asked Rife, “[What’s the] funniest lie you’ve ever heard about yourself?”</p><p>Rife replied, “That I’ve had plastic surgery.” He explained, “That’s the funniest thing in the entire world to me. Because puberty hit me so late. I didn’t look like this until I was 23. Everyone’s like ‘Oh, he’s got cheek fillers, he’s had his lips done, [and] jawline surgery.’”</p><p>Earlier this month, Rife received <a href=#>backlash over his controversial jokes</a> after releasing his first-ever Netflix comedy special.</p><p>Rife kicked off his Natural Selection act by making a joke about domestic violence. He recalled a trip to Baltimore he and his friend took when they had a waitress with a black eye. He first questioned why she wasn’t working in the kitchen to avoid being seen with the injury, but then said, “I feel like if she could cook, she wouldn’t have that black eye.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Elsewhere in the special, he joked about a former classmate having special needs.</p><p>Rife later responded to the criticism via his Instagram Story. “If you’ve ever been offended by a joke I’ve told — here’s a link to my official apology,” he wrote on November 20. The link directed followers to a special needs helmet shopping page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6KutcCMq6CfnV2Yrq240mamrqxdqMKzs8SopWavmKR6q7vKnptmoJmoeqS4yJ6lrWWXpMFur8Cnmp6klZl8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taytaylor-lautner-fiancee-crush-robert-pattinson-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Lautners fiance Admits She Had A Crush On Robert Pattinson Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-jenner-shares-ugly-selfie-with-hailey-baldwin.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Jenner Shares UGLY SELFIE With Hailey Baldwin!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
