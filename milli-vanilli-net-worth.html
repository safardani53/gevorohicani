We had no money. We wanted to be stars."</p><p>Frank Farian discovered the pair after listening to their demo, Girl You Know It's True, and invited them to his studio.</p><p>Shortly after promising to make the young men millionaires, Frank asked them to sign with him.</p><p>But, when they began singing in the studio, the producer decided other performers would be better taking the lead.</p><p>In the end, it was<a href=#> Charles Shaw, John Davis, Brad Howell, Jodie Rocco and her sister Linda Rocco </a>who recorded the hit.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>However, when the song reached international level of fame, Fab and Rob were still lip syncing on stage to the track, <a href=#>which ultimately led to the band's downfall.</a></p><p>Speculation surrounding who the singers were increased as the pair held more interviews, and the public heard their limited English speaking skills.</p><p>Finally, after rumors the band was a sham continued to spiral, Frank admitted Fab and Rob had not sung a word on their album in 1990.</p><p>Fab has since spoken out about the shocking scandal.</p><p>“It was very premeditated,” the 57-year-old told&nbsp;<a href=#>Page Six</a>&nbsp;of attracting the attention of German record producer Frank Farian at a party in the 80s.</p><p>“We had the youth on our side and no experience.”</p><p>He added: “They were able to lead us with a little carrot, you know.</p><p>"And of course, the gold records, you know, seduced by the fact that you’re going to live your dreams just to do that, sign that paper.”</p><h2>What was Milli Vanilli's net worth?</h2><p>The duo reportedly made $2.1million from the hit in 1990.</p><p>Frank told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Los Angeles Times</a>&nbsp;the same year: "I made them rich.</p><p>"Rob and Fab got 3 million marks — $2.1 million — from us.</p><p>"The record companies were very satisfied.</p><p>"The real singers also got rich.</p><p>"And Frank Farian got even richer. Only Rob Pilatus wanted much more.”</p><p>Milli Vanilli won the&nbsp;Best New Artist&nbsp;award at the&nbsp;32nd <a href=#>Grammy Awards</a>, as well as three awards at the&nbsp;17th <a href=#>American Music Awards</a> at the height of their fame.</p><p>However, these prestigious titles were removed after the truth was exposed.</p><h3>Rob Pilatus</h3><p>Rob Pilatus tragically passed away eight years after their shamed exit from the music industry.</p><p>He was aged just 33 years old and died of an&nbsp;<a href=#>alcohol</a>&nbsp;and prescription drug overdose in 1998.</p><p>Fab previously told <a href=# aria-label="Page Six (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Page Six </a>the friends had bonded over childhood trauma and poverty, but that "emotional scars" haunted his friend until his&nbsp;<a href=#>tragic end</a>.</p><h3>Fab Morvan</h3><p>According to <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Fab is estimated to be worth around $250,000.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Although he tried to forge his own music career with Rob following the fall out, the pair never regained success.</p><p>However, Frank is reportedly worth a staggering $40million despite the lip-syncing scandal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZGZ%2FcYSQaKSipJyeeretzaKjpaFdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teresa-giudice-hilariously-flips-out-at-housewives-im-gonna-blow.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;I'm Gonna Blow My Casket!&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-capitol-hill-where-is-it.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Capitol Hill and where is it?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
