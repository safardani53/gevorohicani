Kennedy</strong>’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>30-year-old grandson</a>, made headlines in July 2023 after he <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>slammed his cousin</a>,<strong> Robert F. Kennedy Jr</strong>.’s, bid for presidency. He took to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on July 21 to criticize Robert as an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“embarrassment”</a> after he gave a speech that was full of lies and conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 was manufactured as an ethnically-targeted bioweapon.<span>“Hi, I’m Jack Schlossberg and I have something to say,” the attorney began, as seen in the below video. “President John F. Kennedy is my grandfather and his legacy is important. It’s about a lot more than Camelot and conspiracy theories. It’s about public service and courage. It’s about civil rights, the Cuban missile crisis, and landing a man on the moon.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jack then endorsed President <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joe Biden</strong></a>, listing a handful of improvements he has made to Americans since he took office in 2021.&nbsp;“Joe Biden shares my grandfather’s vision for America. That we do things not because they are easy but because they are hard,” he noted before claiming Biden is “in the middle of becoming the greatest progressive president we’ve ever had.” He explained, “Under Biden, we’ve added 13 million jobs. Unemployment is at its lowest in 60 years. Biden passed the largest investment in infrastructure since The New Deal. And the largest investment in green energy ever. He’s appointed more federal judges than any president since my grandfather. He ended our longest war. He ended the COVID pandemic. And he ended <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a>.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jack then shifted his focus to his cousin, Robert. “These are the issues that matter and if my cousin, Bobby Kennedy Jr., cared about any of them, he would support Joe Biden, too. Instead, he’s trading in on Camelot, celebrity, conspiracy theories, and conflict for personal gain and fame,” Jack slammed. He also seemed to attack his cousin’s personal character as well, adding, “I’ve listened to him. I know him. I have no idea why anyone thinks he should be president. What I do know is his candidacy is an embarrassment. Let’s not be distracted, again, by somebody’s vanity project.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jack previously advocated for Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election, as seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HERE</a>. Read on to learn about lawyer and political activist Jack Schlossberg.</p><h2>1. Jack Is A Lawyer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Born on Jan. 19, 1993, Jack is the youngest child of <strong>Caroline Kennedy</strong> and designer <strong>Edwin Schlossberg</strong>. He is named after his&nbsp;maternal grandfather, John F. Kennedy, and his maternal great-grandfather,<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>John Vernou Bouvier III</strong></a>. Although he comes from one of those most iconic political families, he is a lawyer and has not pursued a full career in politics. He <span>graduated from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yale University</a> in 2015 with a history degree, and in 2022, he graduated from both Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. Jack revealed he passed the New York State bar exam in an<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> April 2023 Instagram post</a>.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jack’s career choice is thanks to his family’s deep American roots, however. “I’m inspired by my family’s legacy of public service,” he said on TODAY in 2017. “It’s something that I’m very proud of.”</p><h2>2. Jack Is His Uncle’s Doppelgänger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jack-Schlossberg-John-F.-Kennedy-Jr-vert.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Jack is the spitting image of his late uncle, <strong>John F. Kennedy, Jr</strong>. It’s to the point that it’s uncanny. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>JFK Jr. died in 1999</a>, when he was just 38 years old, and Jack was 6. Seriously, though, the hair, eyes, and jawline make them practically identical. John Jr. had crazier hair, but total twins otherwise.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Another similarity between Jack and his uncle: political writing. John Jr. was the publisher of George, a now-defunct political magazine out of Washington, D.C. Jack writes about politics, with bylines in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Washington Post</a>, Time, and Politico.</p><h2>3. Jack Lived In Japan During The Obama Administration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/who-is-jack-schlossberg-jfk-grandson-ap-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jack’s mother, Caroline, was the US Ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration, and Jack lived overseas in Japan with her. In his speech as host of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>JFK Profile In Courage Awards</a> in 2017, Jack spoke about his experience:</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I learned a lot about Japan. But the most important thing I learned was about my own country,” Jack said.&nbsp;“It was something I had been told all my life but never fully grasped. I saw how people around the world see America: a beacon of opportunity, stability and strength in a world of uncertainty.&nbsp;America’s historic role has been just that. America, as President Kennedy once described it ‘has always been a lantern in the dark for those who love freedom but are persecuted, in misery, or in need.’”</p><h2>4. Jack Has A Great Sense Of Humor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>“A sense of humor is not genetic, but apparently in the Kennedy family, it can be inherited. President Kennedy’s grandson, Jack Schlossberg, this quality seems to abide,”&nbsp;politician <strong>John Kerry</strong> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>said</a> of Jack in 2011.</p><h2>5. Jack Has Dabbled In Acting</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>On top of being a lawyer and political activist, Jack has dabbled in acting. He had a small spot in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Blue Bloods</a> in 2018, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. His acting resume does not extend beyond that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3oq%2FKZqqcoJykwLSuxKueZmplbIZ3fZRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nick-viall-did-he-dump-jen-saviano-to-be-the-bachelor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Did He Dump Jen Saviano to Be The Bachelor?!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./somo-19870911-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>SoMo (R&amp;amp;B Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
