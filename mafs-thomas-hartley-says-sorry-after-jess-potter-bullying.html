DAILY.”</p><p>The dental hygienist, 31, continued to add: “How can someone who works in mental health think that being nasty about me constantly online, insta lives, insta story’s, podcasts and articles isn’t having an affect on mine…”</p><p>Jess has now accused <a href=#>Thomas </a>of speaking badly about their co-stars too on a podcast.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on MAFS UK">Read More on MAFS UK</h2><p>Thomas, who works as a mental health care assistant, has now addressed her claims on his own social media and “sincerely apologised.”</p><p>He said: “I sincerely apologise for any offence I caused on the podcast. It wasn’t right and I did ask for it to be removed and it wasn’t.</p><p>“I take full responsibility and honestly completely regret the situation and what I said.”</p><p>He went on: “I am honestly so so sorry got any paid caused to anyone. I did ask for them parts to be removed.</p><p>“There’s no excuse, I was out of order massively. I will live eternally with regret.”</p><p>Thomas also said he was "taking time out" and added: "See you in a few."</p><p>Jess has since addressed the podcast Thomas was involved with, which has now been removed, on her own Instagram.</p><p>She said she was “shaking,” as she shared: “I didn’t know if I was going to say anything in regards to the podcast but yeah, it’s literally disgusting.</p><p>“It makes me upset that someone can speak about people’s parents in that way. I don’t understand what can go through people’s minds.”</p><p>She continued: “The people that were spoken about we’re all here for them and really care about them. It’s not ok.</p><p>“I don’t understand how people say hurtful things to boost their career because that’s what it is because it’s f****** disgusting.&nbsp;It’s vile.</p><p>“I was the one who had to tell April and get her to tell Whitney and it’s difficult. I don’t know what to say but I hope everyone can see that this isn’t OK.</p><p>“It’s people’s feelings and mental health. My chin is shaking. I don’t know what to say and I want to give the girls a big cuddle.”</p><p>“Obviously we know the podcast has been removed now, but it shouldn’t have been uploaded in the first place.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“Damage is done and it’s too little too late. Everyone has recordings and everyone has heard what they’ve heard and there’s no going back from it is there.”</p><p>In the podcast in question, Thomas can be heard discussing co-star April Banbury.</p><p>April’s mother left her at a young age and she’s since spoken of the eating disorder she developed while saying it was her “way of coping.”</p><p>In a clip of the podcast shared by Jess, Thomas can be heard saying: “She said her mum abandoned her didn’t she,” while laughing with another person.</p><p>Thomas' co-star Gemma Rose has since unfollowed him on social media too.</p><p>Thomas also appeared in an <a href=#>explosive Instagram live</a>&nbsp;with comedian Kane Brown.</p><p>In the live he Kane asked: "Since the show, who has paired up and done something with someone else?"</p><p>Grinning widely, Thomas did his best to avoid saying his co-stars' names as he shared a rumour he believed to be "90 per cent true".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>He said: "The Harry Potter fan, and this is a rumour, she's slept with people from the cast.</p><p>"I think while the show was going on there was something going on whilst we were filming in the apartments. I actually think it was between two women as well. That one is pretty much 90 per cent definite, and it wasn't Zoe or Jenna, it was two other women."</p><p>Zoe and Jenna were the series' only lesbian couple.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Thomas went on to say the fling he was alluding to was an interracial partnership and neither woman liked him.</p><p>The 'Harry Potter fan' is contestant Jess Potter, whose partnership with stripper PJay Finch became a doomed relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mafs-thomas-hartley-says-sorry-771478432.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/wedding-thomas-adrian-771479030.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpgZ4NxhJNvZqaZlqh6tbTOppisZZiWv7W4xLJkrJmpqHq0u9GrsGaZlqmys3nJnqqsZaCkwbWx0WaZrqScrravs44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pregnant-fitness-blogger-shows-off-abs-taunts-mothers-to-be.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pregnant Fitness Blogger Shows Off Abs, Taunts Mothers-To-Be</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gleb-savchenko-elena-belles-romance-details-how-they-met-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gleb Savchenko, Elena Belles Romance Details: How They Met, More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
