Indeed, this appears to be where the potential value lies.</p><p>Ross Barkley has been in sparkling form, while Andros Townsend is beginning to hit former heights having returned after 18 months out of the game.</p><p>Absentees at the back ‚Äì notably Lockyer but also Issa Kabore ‚Äì are a concern but only increase the chances of one of our bets landing.</p><p>Read on to check out our full betting suggestions for Luton v Chelsea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bet-on-luton-vs-chelsea-the-sun.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luton vs Chelsea key stats</h2><ul><li>Chelsea‚Äôs four consecutive away defeats is their worst such run in the Premier League since 2000.</li><li>Raheem Sterling has 20 ‚Äògoal involvements‚Äô (15 goals, five assists) in his last 19 Premier League games against newly-promoted teams, including two goals against Luton in the reverse fixture.</li><li>Chelsea‚Äôs tally of 25 points is three points lower than last season and is their worst in the first half of a Premier League campaign since their disastrous title defence in 2015/16.</li><li>Luton could welcome Jordan Clark back into their squad after illness but Marvelous Nakamba and Issa Kabore are among those still on the injured list.</li><li>Chelsea will welcome Cole Palmer and Raheem Sterling back from suspension for this game, while Romeo Lavia will be pushing to make his first start.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luton vs Chelsea best bets</h2><p>Find our best bets for the Luton vs Chelsea game below.
