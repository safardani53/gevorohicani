Bill Winkenbach, who was then part owner of the Oakland Raiders (Now Vegas Raiders baby, GO VEGAS!) was hanging out with some friends of his in a New York City hotel room. It was in this hotel room that they established the GOPPPL, or the Greater Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League. It was basically the first <a href=#>Fantasy Football</a> league. Now the pastime's evolved over time with new rules, like what happens when you drop a player in the league.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happens when you drop a player in Fantasy Football varies from league to league.</h2><p>Different leagues have different rules, but generally speaking, there is a waiver period to consider. NFL.com's Digital Care page stipulates the rules as follows: "Typically, players lock on the waiver wire after the draft, at game time, or when a player is dropped from a roster. For undrafted or dropped players, the waiver period begins overnight after going undrafted or being dropped. For players who lock on the waiver wire at game time, the waiver period begins overnight after the final game of the weekend concludes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The site adds: "Default waiver periods last one day, but Custom Leagues can have up to 4 day waiver periods or no waivers at all. To detail an example, in a default-settings league, the waiver period after a game weekend would begin overnight from Monday to Tuesday, then Tuesday would be the one day waiver period, then waivers would process overnight Tuesday to Wednesday."</p><p>So basically, it all depends on the waiver period.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how to drop players on the ESPN Fantasy app.</h2><p>If you're using ESPN to get your fantasy teams together, then it's pretty easy to drop players from your roster.
