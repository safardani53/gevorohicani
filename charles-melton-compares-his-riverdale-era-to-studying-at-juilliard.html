Riverdale truly was my Juilliard — I was learning and growing and playing and taking risks. I was allowed to do that,” he gushed. “It’s bittersweet. But I’m so happy it brought joy to so many people.”</p><p>Melton is excited to continue growing his craft, but he has no plans to <a href=#>explore method acting</a>, adding, “The idea of causing suffering and pain to others around you, in order to tell your story for the character. That is not my cup of chamomile tea.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Charles-Melton-Compares-Riverdale-to-Studying-at-Juilliard-Helped-Me-Redefine-This-Work-Ethic-3.jpg><p>Before his critically acclaimed performance in May December, Melton captivated audiences when he took over for Ross Butler as Reggie on Riverdale. The teen drama, which was based on the iconic Archie Comics, explored a wide variety of <a href=#>over-the-top story lines</a> including cults, killer board games and time travel.</p><p>Melton, for his part, <a href=#>became a breakout star</a> as Reggie sold the town’s hottest designer drug, jingle jangle, and started his own tickle fetish ring.</p><p>After Riverdale came to an end earlier this year, Melton starred as Joe in Netflix’s May December alongside <strong>Natalie Portman </strong>and<strong> Julianne Moore</strong>. He had to <a href=#>put in the work</a> before director<strong> Todd Haynes</strong> cast him in the project.</p><p>“I’m so grateful Charles Melton came into our consciousness. I didn’t know him from Riverdale. His looks were almost a deterrent,” Haynes told Vulture in September about Melton <a href=#>gaining 40 pounds</a> for the role. “I felt that Joe would be a good-looking man, but Charles has that sort of hunkiness and pin-up quality that wasn’t necessarily how I pictured him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Charles-Melton-Compares-Riverdale-to-Studying-at-Juilliard-Helped-Me-Redefine-This-Work-Ethic-4.jpg><p>The director praised Melton for his commitment, adding, “[He did it] to change his chiseled self into something more familiar. A suburban man in this place. There’s such remarkable physicality in the choices he made as an actor. A friend of mine saw a cut of it and he said, ‘Charles moves like a child and an old man, a combination of the two’ — which makes so much sense given his predicament.”</p><p>Melton is not the only former Riverdale star who has said that the show shaped their career. Earlier this year, <a href=#><strong>Madelaine Petsch</strong> discussed how Riverdale </a>taught her some valuable lessons.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The thing that Riverdale did that was really wonderful was [how] we would get scripts morning of — sometimes we would get new rewrites for a scene we were about to shoot in that moment. You really were in an environment where you had to work and think on your feet,” Petsch, 29, exclusively told Us Weekly in July. “Like, you never really got to just settle in and I think that that is a really great boot camp for an actor who wants to continue acting.”</p><p><strong>Lili Reinhart</strong> also weighed in on <a href=#>Riverdale’s legacy</a>, telling Vulture in August, “We can all be happy that we had a f—king consistent job for seven years. I could speak for probably all of us: We will never again do something that’s 100-plus episodes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhmaKhsrR5zJ6jraeeYrCwuc%2BaqZ6rXZ22tHnRoq2eqpSWuaZ5xKuYZqyfYsC1wcOyoKefXZbBbrbUoqOloZGnsXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gilberto-ortiz-19931123-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gilberto Ortiz (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-delano-edwards-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Delano Edwards Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
