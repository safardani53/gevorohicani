But after many long heartfelt talks, I am choosing to see it as a success no matter what label is attached to it publicly."</p><p>Chrishell continued: "Jason was and is my best friend, and other than our ideas for family ultimately not being aligned, the amount of respect and love we have for each other will not change going forward.</p><p>Further providing context, she explained: "Men have the luxury of time that women don't and that's just the way it goes. All of that being said, navigating this public terrain is difficult and I am just trying my best."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>reality star</a> went on to say: "No one would rather only speak about work related things more than me. But I understand this comes with it and I will always love and be extremely grateful for the opportunities I have been given.</p><p>"Although my initial reaction to a private situation was to not speak on it, sometimes it's easier to just live transparently because we only get one chance at this life. I very much hope to one day have a family and decisions I make at this point are with that goal in mind."</p><p>Chrishell's message concluded: "Thank you for the kindness and support to those that understand."</p><p>Her post saw an outpouring of support from her famous friends and fans.</p><p>Cassie Scerbo commented: "Your transparency is so admirable, Chrishell sending you all the best bc you are simply that!"</p><p>Another commenter wrote: "Nothing wrong with being human. Love to you always."</p><p>A third commented: "Stand in your truth mama. Love your transparency and resilience."</p><p>Rachel Lindsay responded to the post: "There is power in knowing exactly what you want and going after it. Wishing you all the best in achieving that."</p><h2>THE SPLIT</h2><p>Sources close to Chrishell and Jason confirmed their split to <a href=#>PEOPLE</a> on Tuesday.</p><p>The pair appeared in an Instagram video posted by Chrishell a week prior.</p><p>No reason for the split was given at the time.</p><p>In an interview with E! News earlier this month, Chrishell opened up about her relationship with Jason.</p><p>She said starting a romance was an "easy transition" for her and Jason because they "were working so much together as it was, and we work so well together."</p><p>Before the split, Jason gushed about Chrishell in an interview with The Sun.</p><p>He said at the time: "Chrishell and I became close friends and it has developed into an amazing relationship.</p><p>"I care about her deeply and we are very happy together."</p><p>They made their relationship Instagram official when they shared a photo from their Italian vacation over the summer.</p><p>Chrishell posted a series of <a href=#>photos from Capri, Italy</a>.</p><p>Her co-stars were present as she and Jason cozied up together.</p><p>She captioned the post: "The JLo effect."</p><p>Before she was <a href=#>linked to Jason</a>, Chrishell had a romance with Dancing With the <a href=#>Stars</a> pro Keo Motsepe.</p><p>They dated for a few months before calling it quits in a public breakup.</p><p>Things between the pair got ugly for a time, with Chrishell <a href=#>blasting Keo for "playing the victim" and "lying."</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>From 2017 to 2021, Chrishell was <a href=#>married to Justin Hartley</a>, best known for his role on the hit series This Is Us.</p><p>He <a href=#>filed for divorce in 2019</a>, citing irreconcilable differences, but the divorce was not finalized until 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000701695036.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000695682794.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000669080284.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Selling Sunset fans slam Chrishell Stause for still talking about ex Justin Hartley on season 4 two years after divorce</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsY2d%2FcYWXaKqepJyeu6h50q6lrJ2kqHqktNGiqqGdnKF6tMDArqqeZaKarrS7zWaZq6ebmnq2vIyjmKynnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./surprising-duggar-sibling-shows-subtle-sign-support-jinger.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Surprising Duggar sibling shows subtle sign of support to Jinger after rebel sister slams 'cult-like</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carlos-santana-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Carlos Santanas Wife?
