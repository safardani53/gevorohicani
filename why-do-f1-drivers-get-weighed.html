A lighter driver gives the team more opportunity to distribute ballast in and around the car to alter or improve a lower center of gravity, e.g. to improve car balance/performance. … It’s a balancing act with car weight, ballast (depending if and how much) and driver weight.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Formula 1 drivers are weighed to keep the playing field even — and to keep them healthy.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One Stop Racing</a>, the reasons for the weigh-in are twofold. For starters, lighter cars have an advantage on the track, and thus taller and heavier drivers were often at a disadvantage. But F1 applied a minimum weight total for the driver and their ballast so that heavier drivers wouldn’t risk their health to lose weight.</p><p>“I think the regulation is good, especially for the taller drivers. It makes life a bit easier,” driver Valtteri Bottas told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a> in March 2019. “Many drivers had to be below our natural weight, and it is very easy to get ill or sick. This is the first winter for many years that I didn’t get any flu or any sickness.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">F1 introduced a minimum driver weight in 2019.</h2><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorsport.com</a> explained in 2018, F1 decided to establish a minimum weight of 80 kilograms — about 176 pounds — for drivers and their seat ballast. The total weight for cars and their drivers rose to 740 kilograms, up from 734 kilograms in 2018, 728 kilograms in 2017, and 702 kilograms before that.</p><p>The 80-kilogram minimum for drivers and their seats meant that a 70-kilogram driver would need 10 kilograms of seat ballast below them, the site explained.</p><p>“It’s been a common topic over many years; actually, it’s not a fresh point,” Paddy Lowe, then the technical chief for the Williams Racing team, told Motorsport.com at the time. “If you go back many years, actually, the driver weight was not in the car weight at all. And then it became added somewhere in the mid-‘90s to the total weight. But it’s still left, as some perceive — including many of the drivers — a problem around their management of weight. Sometimes that can affect them personally in quite a big way.”</p><p>He went on: “I think particularly with younger drivers it can even lead to health problems, because of this constant drive to lower the weight, to possibly unhealthy levels. Personally, I think it’d be a good thing for the sport, something that many drivers have been asking for for many years, to take that element away, within reason.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZJ9pXZm%2FqsLEq6pmn5WperixyKCfnpw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarafina-belafonte.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Sarafina Belafonte net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aline-bernardes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aline Bernardes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
