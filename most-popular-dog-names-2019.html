Online pet care platform, Rover, just released the most popular dog names from this past year, and let me tell you, pet owners got really creative. So, what are the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular dog names from 2019</a>? Here's the best of the bunch.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The most popular dog names for 2019 include some classics — and some celebs.</h2><p>Who run the world? Girls. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The most common female dog name</a> of 2019 is undeniably adorable — it's seriously pulling at my heartstrings right now. According to Rover, Bella took the lead, followed by Luna, Lucy, Daisy, Lily, Zoe, Lola, Molly, Sadie, and Bailey. Will I be naming a golden retriever Daisy in the next year? Absolutely, that's my goal for 2020.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The most popular male dog names aren't too surprising, but they're cute nonetheless. First we have Max, which is followed by Charlie, Cooper, Buddy, Rocky, Milo, Jack, Bear, Duke, and Teddy. I've met many Max's and several Cooper's, but not too many Rocky's. It's overall a pretty stellar pick of names, though, and like I said, they definitely don't disappoint.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Celeb-inspired pet names became increasingly popular this year.</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, according to the press release, this year's top musicians inspired several fur baby names. The name Lizzo, for example, shot up by 100 percent, with Beyonce shooting up by 78 percent. Taylor Swift even skyrocketed to a whopping 400 percent, which is truly an enigma in my eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This year's most popular TV shows also inspired a wide variety of names. For example, the name Maisel (of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) shot up by 1000 percent (which comes as no surprise) and Arya Stark, which increased by a total of 150 percent.&nbsp;Personally, I probably would have gone with Hodor, but it's all about personal preference, I suppose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Human names also became increasingly popular.</h2><p>Rover's press release revealed that 55 percent of pet parents have already given their fur baby a "human name," or that they would consider giving a pet a human name. The app also revealed that 25 percent would consider giving a desired baby name to their beloved furry friend. &nbsp;</p><p>A few of the trending "human-inspired" pet names from this year included Dorothy, Elaine, and Dennis.&nbsp;Honestly, the prospect of owning a bulldog named Dennis is a dream come true, if you ask me.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And with the growth of marijuana legalization throughout the U.S., cannabis-inspired names are on the rise.</h2><p>That's right, folks — there's a cannabis craze among pet owners these days, and honestly, I'm not mad about it. Weed-inspired names like Budder, Dank, Doobie, Blaze, and Kush are becoming more and more common for dogs, while names like Kush, Doobie, and Blaze have gotten increasingly more trendy among cats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Likewise, food-inspired names are serving as inspiration as well. The name Rosé shot up by 183 percent, while dessert names such as Cake, Croissant, and Cupcake went up, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Kate Jaffe, a trend expert at Rover, explained this is because pet names show what owners are most passionate about. In the press release, she said:</p><p>"The names we give our pets provide a peek into our passions, aspirations, happy places, and guilty pleasures, reinforcing what we at Rover know to be true: our pets are as unique as the names we lovingly bestow upon them. That’s why we're so honored that hundreds of thousands of pet parents trust us with their furry family members."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Maybe these ~trending pet names~ will serve as inspiration when you adopt your next fur baby, or maybe, you'll think of something totally original. Either way, though, this is seriously making me want a dog...
