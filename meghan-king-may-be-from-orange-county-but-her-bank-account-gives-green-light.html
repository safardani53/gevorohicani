But there really is truth to that speculation.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Several years since she left the show, we done some digging into Meghan’s current finances.</p>BridTV6970The Real Housewives of Miami | New Season Official Trailer | Peacock Originalhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/54-qk-H06pU/hqdefault.jpg911393911393center22403<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-she-waved-goodbye-to-rhoc>Why she waved goodbye to RHOC</h2><p>Meghan, who appeared on RHOC from 2015 to 2017, left the show after discovering she was pregnant with twins. However, that doesn’t mean she isn’t missing filming for the reality series.</p><p>In fact, she said she would consider returning to the Real Housewives as a friend, after a guest appearance in Season 14. However, Meghan currently lives in Los Angeles, so it would be difficult unless she moved back to OC.</p><p>Meghan told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Hollywood Life</a>: “I walked away because of the twins. I was pregnant with twins. I miss [the show]. I liked it.</p><p>“I told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Andy&nbsp;[Cohen]</a>&nbsp;that I really want to consider coming back as a ‘friend’, but I’m kind of not really dead set on it [yet]. So if he [asked me to come back] I’d be like, ‘Well, let’s talk.”</p><p>When she left, Meghan was pregnant with ex Jim Edmonds’ children, who she has since divorced from. The former couple are both parents to Aspen,&nbsp;Hayes&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hart.</p><p>Meghan recently split from ex-husband Cuffe Biden Owens, who she married in 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Does anyone want Meghan back?

She launched the store back in August 2021, and is also thought to write for a living.</p><p>She now works as a blogger and podcast co-host.

According to Realtor.com, her home is now worth around $945K.</p><p>The home, which has hardwood floors and 9-foot ceilings, has a walk-in closet and four bedrooms, including a large master suite with a glamorous master bathroom!</p><p>She appears to get an income from social media and partnerships, and often writes on her <a href=# rel=nofollow>own blog</a>.

This includes launching a hat company named Hashtag Hats, as well as a line of personal care products and candles named The King Collection.</p><p>With 1million followers on Instagram, her net worth has remained just as high as when she left the show, mainly through her large social media following.
