I think they are phenomenal,” Hamza gushed after a couple of hours of judging.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>John</a>, 82, said that the standard of photos “gets better and better every year.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON COUNTRYFILE">READ MORE ON COUNTRYFILE</h2><p>“We’ve seen hundreds of images that could have made it into the Countryfile calendar,” he added.</p><p>John and Hamza really liked one <a href=#>Edith</a> honed onto, which showed gannets flying in and out of the water.</p><p>Hamza said: “An image like that made you stop, made you examine it, made you think about it. To me, that’s a beautiful image for us to potentially consider for Wild Britain.”</p><p>However, they ultimately didn’t choose that photo.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Likewise, there was one of two foxes play-fighting in a green field, which viewers really loved, that the judges rejected. “When we first started, we thought this was a pretty good action shot, but we all say no now,” Hamza said.&nbsp;</p><p>The judges continued to be very critical as they narrowed down the final 12 photos.</p><p>“It’s certainly getting trickier. I’m finding it harder to pick an image that I like,” Hamza said while he, Edith, and John started turning down more impressive photos.</p><p>Edith rejected a vibrant picture of a deer in a forest, saying: “No. I feel like I’ve seen that picture before.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Hamza snubbed a black and white photo of waves crashing around a lighthouse. “I like what they were thinking. I just need a bit more drama in the clouds and stuff.”</p><p>John then turned down a shot of a beaver in a stream. “It’s not a staggering picture, is it? I think it’s an interesting animal, but the picture isn’t,” he said.</p><p>The judges’ criticism didn’t sit right with viewers who took to <a href=#>social media</a> to voice their complaints.&nbsp;</p><p>“I feel sorry for the photographers whose entries they’re slagging off - that’s never been shown before! I like a lot of the rejected ones more than those that made the final 12,” said one disappointed viewer.</p><p>“Wow, Countryfile choosing the 12 viewers’ photos for 2024 calendar - I’m sure it’s a hard decision but showing pics to camera and then dismissing them with sneering comments as not suitable for inclusion is a bit harsh!” another commented.</p><p>The final 12 photos Hamza, Edith, and John picked are impressive images, but viewers were still livid that some of the beautiful ones shown earlier were not chosen.&nbsp;</p><p>“All that deliberation and they’ve chosen some naff photos for the calendar,” a third viewer said.</p><p>“Once again there’s a few in the Countryfile calendar final 12 that are nowhere near as interesting as ones they passed over,” added a fourth.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“The final 12 photos that they’ve chosen for the 2024 calendar are a bit disappointing. There were definitely better photos that they said no to,” a fifth viewer agreed.</p><p>“Really quite disappointed there by the final selection,” a sixth viewer piled on. “The sheep up the mountain looking at the photographer was much better than the one chosen and the same with the foxes. The blue tit reflection shot was amazing but didn’t make it either.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bbc-countryfile-hamza-yassin-john-837967490.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/use-21-days-issue-use-783581015.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGpjaYR2hZRrZpynpaPBs8XFoqOeZaaesrix0axkpaGmnrFuv9OroJysnK56pLTApqdmoJGix6J50qWYoKtdpLOnec%2Bhpq2nl6eusbTEq6po</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gwyn-jay-allen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Gwyn Jay Allen net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./girl-in-reds-boyfriend-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Girl In Red Dating Girl In Red's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ava-london-and-hank-baskett-totally-hooked-up-climaxed-together.html>Ava London and Hank Baskett Totally Hooked Up, Achieved Orgasm Quickly, Friend Says</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./can-floyd-mayweather-read-and-write.html>Can Floyd Mayweather Read and Write? 50 Cent Sure Doesn't Think So</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jessy-hartel-19980102-html.html>Jessy Hartel (Instagram Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./riverdale-lili-reinhart-2-7m-spanish-inspired-estate-wine-stunning-la-views.html>Riverdale star Lili Reinhart buys massive $2.7m Spanish-inspired estate featuring wine room and stun</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-damon-thomas-dating.html>Who is Damon Thomas Dating Now</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeZ.
