family.</p><p>Most of the fascination has centered around the <a href=#>bizarre beliefs of Jim Bob Duggar</a> and the culture of abuse and extreme secrecy that the father of 19 helped to create.</p><p>But as fans of Shiny embark on multiple viewings in the hope of better understanding this American tragedy, many of them are turning their attention to Duggars who were barely mentioned in the doc.</p><p>That means many newcomers to the Duggar discourse are just now becoming familiar with <a href=#>the sad story of Jana Duggar</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/01/jana-d-pic.jpg><p>Unlike most of her siblings, Jana Duggar has chosen not to marry or have children.</p><p>She’s only 33, and she obviously has a lot of time to change her mind, but Duggar women are taught from a young age that procreation is their primary reason for being.</p><p>Most of Jana’s sisters married very young and started families shortly thereafter — so her decision not to do the same is considered by many a bold act of rebellion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2021/06/jana-counting-on.png><p>There’s been a good deal of conversation about why Jana has decided to remain single.</p><p>These days, the most common theory is that she decided to forgo having kids of her own so that she could stay at home and protect her younger siblings.</p><p>As you’re probably aware, Jana’s eldest brother, <a href=#>Josh Duggar, molested four of his sisters</a>, and his parents helped him to avoid any legal consequences for his crimes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Over the course of the past decade, Jill, Jessa and others who were victimized by Josh married and moved away from the house of horrors in which they were raised, prompting Jana to make a move of a different kind.</p><p>Jana now shares a room with her youngest sisters, and insiders say she’s happily taken on the role of a second mother.</p><p>The Duggars have always used a “buddy system,” in which elder siblings are responsible for their younger brothers and sisters, so this type of arrangement is nothing new to Jana.</p><a href=#><img width=1478 height=1028

A passerby who saw the child called the police,” she continued.</p><p>“This resulted in a written citation, as well as a follow-up with child welfare who concluded that it was an accident and the child was unharmed.</p><p>“They recognized it was a case of a child slipping out of the house when you turn your back for a moment.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The incident prompted Jana to take a step back from Instagram, where she used to post rather frequently.</p><p>These days, she lives a quiet life away from the spotlight.</p><p>And while Jana is obviously dedicated to the support and protection of her younger siblings, many have expressed hope that her own needs are not being neglected.</p><p>s</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WDcLbAp5hmnKWctKK%2BjJ2gnWWjnbJuv9OasGarmaO0rbGMoqVmp6KZsrN506hkqaqfqbKkwIyhnKtlo56vrbXNoKpmnqKkum62yKZkm6eSYq6vsIytn55lmZe5sXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-harris-politician.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fame | Jeff Harris (politician) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kimi-evans-age-married-height-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Kimi Evans Age?
